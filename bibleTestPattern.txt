Care
We suggest loosening the binding of your new Bible by gently pressing on a small section of pages at a time from
the center. To ensure against breakage of the spine, it is best not to bend the cover backward around the spine or
to carry study notes, church bulletins, pens, etc., inside the cover. Because a felt-tipped marker will "bleed"
through the pages, we recommend use of a ballpoint pen or pencil to underline favorite passages. Your Bible
should not be exposed to excessive heat, cold or humidity. Protecting the gold or silver edges of the paper from
moisture will avoid spotting, streaking or fading.

Alphabetic List of Books
iv
What Is the Bible?
The word Bible means book. The Bible was
given this name because it is the book of Gods
words to us. The Bible is also sometimes
called Scripture, a word meaning something
written. The Bible is like a library of 66 books
put together into one big book. But all the
books within the Bible talk about the same
subject: Gods message to us. The Bible tells us
about God, shows us Gods mighty acts in the
lives of his people, and describes how people
responded to God. From the Bible we learn
what God is like and what he expects of us.
How the Bible Was Written
It took about 1,500 years for the whole Bible to
be writtenfrom Genesis, written at the time
of Moses, to Revelation, written by the apostle
John about 65 years after Jesus death. The
books of the Bible had many different authors,
living at different times and in different places.
Yet not one of these writers contradicts another.
God guided them so that they wrote in their
own words what he wanted them to say. This
means that the Bible is a completely dependable
and trustworthy book. We can believe
everything it says because it comes from God.
The Old Testament
The Bible has two major partsthe Old Testament
and the New Testament. The Old Testament
is a collection of 39 books. Both Jews and
Christians accept these books as Scripture. The
Old Testament starts with the creation of the
universe and of the human race. Then it continues
with the history of Gods chosen people
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their descendants,
whom God formed into the nation of
Israel. In the Old Testament God begins to
show his plan for saving people from sin.
Through his prophets he promised many times
to send the Messiah, the savior of sinners.
The New Testament
The New Testament is made up of 27 books
accepted by Christians as Scripture. It tells
about the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ,
and about the beginning of the Christian
church. It describes the life, death and resurrection
of Jesus. It explains why he died, and it
teaches us how we can be saved from sin.
How the Bible Came to Us
When the books of the Bible were first written,
the only way people could have a copy was for
someone to write it out entirely by hand. This
work was done by men called scribes, who
spent their entire day copying the Bible letter
by letter. Because this was a long, tiresome
job, few people had their own copy of the
Bible.
The Old Testament was first written in the Hebrew
and Aramaic languages. About 250 years
before Jesus birth, it was translated into Greek
(this text was called the Septuagint). All of the
New Testament was written in Greek. About 350
years after Jesus death, Jerome, who was a
leader in the early church, translated the Bible
into Latin, the language commonly spoken by
many people at that time. Several hundred
years later, most people no longer spoke Latin.
But even so, Jeromes translation, called the Vulgate,
was the official Bible in Western Europe
for more than 1,000 years.
In the late 1300s, John Wycliffe came to believe
that it was important for all Christians to
read the Bible in their own language. He and his
followers were the first to translate the whole
Bible into English. But because the printing
press had not yet been invented, copies were
made by hand and very few were available.
About 140 years later, William Tyndale translated
the New Testament from Greek to English.
At that time the printing press was available, so
Tyndales Bible was the first English Bible printed
on a press.
In 1611 the best-known English Bible, the
King James Version, was published. It was revised
many times over many years but remained
the standard translation well into the
twentieth century.
During the second half of the twentieth century
many new translations became available.
The most popular is the New International
Version, the translation you are reading today.
About the Bible
v
THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION is a
completely new translation of the Holy Bible
made by over a hundred scholars working directly
from the best available Hebrew, Aramaic
and Greek texts. It had its beginning in 1965
when, after several years of exploratory study
by committees from the Christian Reformed
Church and the National Association of Evangelicals,
a group of scholars met at Palos
Heights, Illinois, and concurred in the need for
a new translation of the Bible in contemporary
English. This group, though not made up of official
church representatives, was transdenominational.
Its conclusion was endorsed by a
large number of leaders from many denominations
who met in Chicago in 1966.
Responsibility for the new version was delegated
by the Palos Heights group to a self-governing
body of fifteen, the Committee on Bible
Translation, composed for the most part of biblical
scholars from colleges, universities and
seminaries. In 1967 the New York Bible Society
(now the International Bible Society) generously
undertook the financial sponsorship of the
projecta sponsorship that made it possible to
enlist the help of many distinguished scholars.
The fact that participants from the United
States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia and
New Zealand worked together gave the project
its international scope. That they were from
many denominationsincluding Anglican, Assemblies
of God, Baptist, Brethren, Christian
Reformed, Church of Christ, Evangelical Free,
Lutheran, Mennonite, Methodist, Nazarene,
Presbyterian, Wesleyan and other churches
helped to safeguard the translation from sectarian
bias.
How it was made helps to give the New International
Version its distinctiveness. The
translation of each book was assigned to a
team of scholars. Next, one of the Intermediate
Editorial Committees revised the initial translation,
with constant reference to the Hebrew, Aramaic
or Greek. Their work then went to one of
the General Editorial Committees, which
checked it in detail and made another thorough
revision. This revision in turn was carefully
reviewed by the Committee on Bible
Translation, which made further changes and
then released the final version for publication.
In this way the entire Bible underwent three revisions,
during each of which the translation
was examined for its faithfulness to the original
languages and for its English style.
All this involved many thousands of hours of
research and discussion regarding the meaning
of the texts and the precise way of putting them
into English. It may well be that no other translation
has been made by a more thorough
process of review and revision from committee
to committee than this one.
From the beginning of the project, the Committee
on Bible Translation held to certain
goals for the New International Version: that it
would be an accurate translation and one that
would have clarity and literary quality and so
prove suitable for public and private reading,
teaching, preaching, memorizing and liturgical
use. The Committee also sought to preserve
some measure of continuity with the long tradition
of translating the Scriptures into English.
In working toward these goals, the translators
were united in their commitment to the
authority and infallibility of the Bible as Gods
Word in written form. They believe that it contains
the divine answer to the deepest needs of
humanity, that it sheds unique light on our
path in a dark world, and that it sets forth the
way to our eternal well-being.
The first concern of the translators has been
the accuracy of the translation and its fidelity to
the thought of the biblical writers. They have
weighed the significance of the lexical and
grammatical details of the Hebrew, Aramaic
and Greek texts. At the same time, they have
striven for more than a word-for-word translation.
Because thought patterns and syntax differ
from language to language, faithful communication
of the meaning of the writers of the
Bible demands frequent modifications in sentence
structure and constant regard for the
contextual meanings of words.
A sensitive feeling for style does not always
accompany scholarship. Accordingly the Com-
PREFACE TO THE
New International Version
PREFACE vii
mittee on Bible Translation submitted the developing
version to a number of stylistic consultants.
Two of them read every book of both
Old and New Testaments twiceonce before
and once after the last major revisionand
made invaluable suggestions. Samples of the
translation were tested for clarity and ease of
reading by various kinds of peopleyoung and
old, highly educated and less well educated,
ministers and laymen.
Concern for clear and natural Englishthat
the New International Version should be idiomatic
but not idiosyncratic, contemporary
but not datedmotivated the translators and
consultants. At the same time, they tried to reflect
the differing styles of the biblical writers. In
view of the international use of English, the
translators sought to avoid obvious Americanisms
on the one hand and obvious Anglicisms
on the other. A British edition reflects the comparatively
few differences of significant idiom
and of spelling.
As for the traditional pronouns thou,
thee and thine in reference to the Deity, the
translators judged that to use these archaisms
(along with the old verb forms such as doest,
wouldest and hadst) would violate accuracy
in translation. Neither Hebrew, Aramaic nor
Greek uses special pronouns for the persons of
the Godhead. A present-day translation is not
enhanced by forms that in the time of the King
James Version were used in everyday speech,
whether referring to God or man.
For the Old Testament the standard Hebrew
text, the Masoretic Text as published in the latest
editions of Biblia Hebraica, was used
throughout. The Dead Sea Scrolls contain material
bearing on an earlier stage of the Hebrew
text. They were consulted, as were the Samaritan
Pentateuch and the ancient scribal traditions
relating to textual changes. Sometimes a
variant Hebrew reading in the margin of the
Masoretic Text was followed instead of the text
itself. Such instances, being variants within the
Masoretic tradition, are not specified by footnotes.
In rare cases, words in the consonantal
text were divided differently from the way they
appear in the Masoretic Text. Footnotes indicate
this. The translators also consulted the
more important early versionsthe Septuagint;
Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion; the
Vulgate; the Syriac Peshitta; the Targums; and
for the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome.
Readings from these versions were occasionally
followed where the Masoretic Text seemed
doubtful and where accepted principles of textual
criticism showed that one or more of these
textual witnesses appeared to provide the correct
reading. Such instances are footnoted.
Sometimes vowel letters and vowel signs did
not, in the judgment of the translators, represent
the correct vowels for the original consonantal
text. Accordingly some words were read
with a different set of vowels. These instances
are usually not indicated by footnotes.
The Greek text used in translating the New
Testament was an eclectic one. No other piece
of ancient literature has such an abundance of
manuscript witnesses as does the New Testament.
Where existing manuscripts differ, the
translators made their choice of readings according
to accepted principles of New Testament
textual criticism. Footnotes call attention
to places where there was uncertainty about
what the original text was. The best current
printed texts of the Greek New Testament were
used.
There is a sense in which the work of translation
is never wholly finished. This applies to
all great literature and uniquely so to the Bible.
In 1973 the New Testament in the New International
Version was published. Since then, suggestions
for corrections and revisions have
been received from various sources. The Committee
on Bible Translation carefully considered
the suggestions and adopted a number of
them. These were incorporated in the first
printing of the entire Bible in 1978. Additional
revisions were made by the Committee on
Bible Translation in 1983 and appear in printings
after that date.
As in other ancient documents, the precise
meaning of the biblical texts is sometimes uncertain.
This is more often the case with the
Hebrew and Aramaic texts than with the Greek
text. Although archaeological and linguistic
discoveries in this century aid in understanding
difficult passages, some uncertainties remain.
The more significant of these have been called
to the readers attention in the footnotes.
In regard to the divine name YHWH, commonly
referred to as the Tetragrammaton, the
translators adopted the device used in most
English versions of rendering that name as
LORD in capital letters to distinguish it from
Adonai, another Hebrew word rendered Lord,
for which small letters are used. Wherever the
two names stand together in the Old Testament
as a compound name of God, they are rendered
Sovereign LORD.
Because for most readers today the phrases
the LORD of hosts and God of hosts have little
meaning, this version renders them the LORD
Almighty and God Almighty. These render-
viii PREFACE
ings convey the sense of the Hebrew, namely,
he who is sovereign over all the hosts (powers)
in heaven and on earth, especially over the
hosts (armies) of Israel. For readers unacquainted
with Hebrew this does not make clear
the distinction between Sabaoth (hosts or
Almighty) and Shaddai (which can also be
translated Almighty), but the latter occurs infrequently
and is always footnoted. When
Adonai and YHWH Sabaoth occur together,
they are rendered the Lord, the LORD Almighty.
As for other proper nouns, the familiar
spellings of the King James Version are generally
retained. Names traditionally spelled with
ch, except where it is final, are usually spelled
in this translation with k or c, since the biblical
languages do not have the sound that ch
frequently indicates in Englishfor example, in
chant. For well-known names such as Zechariah,
however, the traditional spelling has been
retained. Variation in the spelling of names in
the original languages has usually not been indicated.
Where a person or place has two or
more different names in the Hebrew, Aramaic
or Greek texts, the more familiar one has generally
been used, with footnotes where needed.
To achieve clarity the translators sometimes
supplied words not in the original texts but required
by the context. If there was uncertainty
about such material, it is enclosed in brackets.
Also for the sake of clarity or style, nouns, including
some proper nouns, are sometimes
substituted for pronouns, and vice versa. And
though the Hebrew writers often shifted back
and forth between first, second and third personal
pronouns without change of antecedent,
this translation often makes them uniform, in
accordance with English style and without the
use of footnotes.
Poetical passages are printed as poetry, that
is, with indentation of lines and with separate
stanzas. These are generally designed to reflect
the structure of Hebrew poetry. This poetry is
normally characterized by parallelism in balanced
lines. Most of the poetry in the Bible is in
the Old Testament, and scholars differ regarding
the scansion of Hebrew lines. The translators
determined the stanza divisions for the
most part by analysis of the subject matter. The
stanzas therefore serve as poetic paragraphs.
As an aid to the reader, italicized sectional
headings are inserted in most of the books.
They are not to be regarded as part of the NIV
text, are not for oral reading, and are not intended
to dictate the interpretation of the sections
they head.
The footnotes in this version are of several
kinds, most of which need no explanation.
Those giving alternative translations begin
with Or and generally introduce the alternative
with the last word preceding it in the text,
except when it is a single-word alternative; in
poetry quoted in a footnote a slant mark indicates
a line division. Footnotes introduced by
Or do not have uniform significance. In some
cases two possible translations were considered
to have about equal validity. In other
cases, though the translators were convinced
that the translation in the text was correct, they
judged that another interpretation was possible
and of sufficient importance to be represented
in a footnote.
In the New Testament, footnotes that refer
to uncertainty regarding the original text are
introduced by Some manuscripts or similar
expressions. In the Old Testament, evidence for
the reading chosen is given first and evidence
for the alternative is added after a semicolon
(for example: Septuagint; Hebrew father). In
such notes the term Hebrew refers to the Masoretic
Text.
It should be noted that minerals, flora and
fauna, architectural details, articles of clothing
and jewelry, musical instruments and other articles
cannot always be identified with precision.
Also measures of capacity in the biblical
period are particularly uncertain (see the table
of weights and measures following the text).
Like all translations of the Bible, made as
they are by imperfect man, this one undoubtedly
falls short of its goals. Yet we are grateful to
God for the extent to which he has enabled us
to realize these goals and for the strength he
has given us and our colleagues to complete
our task. We offer this version of the Bible to
him in whose name and for whose glory it has
been made. We pray that it will lead many into a
better understanding of the Holy Scriptures
and a fuller knowledge of Jesus Christ the incarnate
Word, of whom the Scriptures so faithfully
testify.

Old Testament
THE

The Beginning
1 In the beginning God created the heavens and
the earth. 2Now the earth was a formless and empty,
darkness was over the surface of the deep, and
the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
3 And God said, Let there be light, and there was
light. 4God saw that the light was good, and he
separated the light from the darkness. 5God called
the light day, and the darkness he called night.
And there was evening, and there was morning
the first day.
6 And God said, Let there be an expanse between the
waters to separate water from water. 7So God
made the expanse and separated the water under
the expanse from the water above it. And it was so.
8God called the expanse sky. And there was evening,
and there was morningthe second day.
9 And God said, Let the water under the sky be gathered
to one place, and let dry ground appear. And
it was so. 10God called the dry ground land, and
the gathered waters he called seas. And God saw
that it was good.
11Then God said, Let the land produce vegetation:
seed-bearing plants and trees on the land
that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their
various kinds. And it was so. 12The land produced
vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their
kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according
to their kinds. And God saw that it was
good. 13And there was evening, and there was
morningthe third day.
14 And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of
the sky to separate the day from the night, and let
them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and
years, 15and let them be lights in the expanse of
the sky to give light on the earth. And it was so.
16God made two great lightsthe greater light to
govern the day and the lesser light to govern the
night. He also made the stars. 17God set them in
the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth,
18to govern the day and the night, and to separate
light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.
19And there was evening, and there was morning
the fourth day.
20 And God said, Let the water teem with living creatures,
and let birds fly above the earth across the
expanse of the sky. 21So God created the great
creatures of the sea and every living and moving
thing with which the water teems, according to
their kinds, and every winged bird according to its
kind. And God saw that it was good. 22God blessed
them and said, Be fruitful and increase in number
and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase
on the earth. 23And there was evening, and
there was morningthe fifth day.
24 And God said, Let the land produce living creatures
according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that
move along the ground, and wild animals, each
according to its kind. And it was so. 25God made
the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock
according to their kinds, and all the creatures
that move along the ground according to
their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
26Then God said, Let us make man in our image,
in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish
of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock,
over all the earth, b and over all the creatures
that move along the ground.
27 So God created man in his own image,
in the image of God he created him;
male and female he created them.
28God blessed them and said to them, Be fruitful
and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue
it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of
the air and over every living creature that moves on
the ground.
29Then God said, I give you every seed-bearing
plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree
that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for
food. 30And to all the beasts of the earth and all the
birds of the air and all the creatures that move on
the groundeverything that has the breath of life
in itI give every green plant for food. And it
was so.
31God saw all that he had made, and it was very
good. And there was evening, and there was
morningthe sixth day.
2 Thus the heavens and the earth were completed
in all their vast array.
2 By the seventh day God had finished the work he had
been doing; so on the seventh day he rested c from
all his work. 3And God blessed the seventh day
and made it holy, because on it he rested from all
the work of creating that he had done.
Adam and Eve
4This is the account of the heavens and the earth
when they were created.
When the LORD God made the earth and the heavens
5and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on
the earth d and no plant of the field had yet sprung up,
for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth d and
there was no man to work the ground, 6but streams e
came up from the earth and watered the whole surface
of the ground 7the LORD God formed the man f from
the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
8Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the
east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.
9And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of
the groundtrees that were pleasing to the eye and
good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree
of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis
a 2 Or possibly became b 26 Hebrew; Syriac all the wild animals c 2 Or ceased; also in verse 3 d 5 Or land; also in verse 6 e 6 Or
mist f 7 The Hebrew for man (adam) sounds like and may be related to the Hebrew for ground (adamah); it is also the name Adam (see
Gen. 2:20).
10A river watering the garden flowed from Eden;
from there it was separated into four headwaters. 11The
name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire
land of Havilah, where there is gold. 12(The gold of
that land is good; aromatic resin a and onyx are also
there.) 13The name of the second river is the Gihon; it
winds through the entire land of Cush. b 14The name of
the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of
Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
15The LORD God took the man and put him in the
Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. 16And the
LORD God commanded the man, You are free to eat
from any tree in the garden; 17but you must not eat
from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for
when you eat of it you will surely die.
18The LORD God said, It is not good for the man to be
alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.
19Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground
all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He
brought them to the man to see what he would name
them; and whatever the man called each living creature,
that was its name. 20So the man gave names to all
the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the
field.
But for Adamc no suitable helper was found. 21So
the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep;
and while he was sleeping, he took one of the mans
ribs d and closed up the place with flesh. 22Then the
LORD God made a woman from the rib e he had taken
out of the man, and he brought her to the man.
23The man said,
This is now bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh;
she shall be called woman, f
for she was taken out of man.
24For this reason a man will leave his father and mother
and be united to his wife, and they will become one
flesh.
25The man and his wife were both naked, and they
felt no shame.
The Fall of Man
3 Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the
wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the
woman, Did God really say, You must not eat from any
tree in the garden?
2The woman said to the serpent, We may eat fruit
from the trees in the garden, 3but God did say, You
must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of
the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die. 
4You will not surely die, the serpent said to the
woman. 5For God knows that when you eat of it your
eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing
good and evil.
6When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was
good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable
for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also
gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate
it. 7Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and
they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves
together and made coverings for themselves.
8Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the
LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of
the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the
trees of the garden. 9But the LORD God called to the
man, Where are you?
10He answered, I heard you in the garden, and I was
afraid because I was naked; so I hid.
11And he said, Who told you that you were naked?
Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you
not to eat from?
12The man said, The woman you put here with
meshe gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.
13Then the LORD God said to the woman, What is
this you have done?
The woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I
ate.
14So the LORD God said to the serpent, Because you
have done this,
Cursed are you above all the livestock
and all the wild animals!
You will crawl on your belly
and you will eat dust
all the days of your life.
15 And I will put enmity
between you and the woman,
and between your offspring g and hers;
he will crush h your head,
and you will strike his heel.
16To the woman he said,
I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing;
with pain you will give birth to children.
Your desire will be for your husband,
and he will rule over you.
17To Adam he said, Because you listened to your
wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded
you, You must not eat of it,
Cursed is the ground because of you;
through painful toil you will eat of it
all the days of your life.
18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you,
and you will eat the plants of the field.
19By the sweat of your brow
you will eat your food
until you return to the ground,
since from it you were taken;
for dust you are
and to dust you will return.
20Adami named his wife Eve, j because she would
become the mother of all the living.
21The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam
and his wife and clothed them. 22And the LORD God
said, The man has now become like one of us, knowing
good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his
hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live
forever. 23So the LORD God banished him from the Garden
of Eden to work the ground from which he had
been taken. 24After he drove the man out, he placed on
the east side k of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a
flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way
to the tree of life.
Cain and Abel
4 Adami lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant
and gave birth to Cain. l She said, With the
help of the LORD I have brought forth m a man. 2Later
she gave birth to his brother Abel.
Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. 3In
the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of
the soil as an offering to the LORD. 4But Abel brought fat
portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The
LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, 5but on
Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain
was very angry, and his face was downcast.
6Then the LORD said to Cain, Why are you angry?
Why is your face downcast? 7If you do what is right, will

you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right,
sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but
you must master it.
8Now Cain said to his brother Abel, Lets go out to
the field. a And while they were in the field, Cain attacked
his brother Abel and killed him.
9Then the LORD said to Cain, Where is your brother
Abel?
I dont know, he replied. Am I my brothers keeper?
10The LORD said, What have you done? Listen! Your
brothers blood cries out to me from the ground. 11Now
you are under a curse and driven from the ground,
which opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood
from your hand. 12When you work the ground, it will no
longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer
on the earth.
13Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is more
than I can bear. 14Today you are driving me from the
land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be
a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me
will kill me.
15But the LORD said to him, Not so b; if anyone kills
Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over. Then
the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found
him would kill him. 16So Cain went out from the LORDs
presence and lived in the land of Nod, c east of Eden.
17Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant
and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city,
and he named it after his son Enoch. 18To Enoch was
born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael
was the father of Methushael, and Methushael
was the father of Lamech.
19Lamech married two women, one named Adah
and the other Zillah. 20Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was
the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.
21His brothers name was Jubal; he was the father of all
who play the harp and flute. 22Zillah also had a son, Tubal-
Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of d bronze
and iron. Tubal-Cains sister was Naamah.
23Lamech said to his wives,
Adah and Zillah, listen to me;
wives of Lamech, hear my words.
I have killed e a man for wounding me,
a young man for injuring me.
24 If Cain is avenged seven times,
then Lamech seventy-seven times.
25Adam lay with his wife again, and she gave birth to
a son and named him Seth, f saying, God has granted
me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed
him. 26Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh.
At that time men began to call on g the name of the
LORD.
From Adam to Noah
5 This is the written account of Adams line.
When God created man, he made him in the likeness
of God. 2He created them male and female and
blessed them. And when they were created, he called
them man. h
3When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in
his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him
Seth. 4After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and
had other sons and daughters. 5Altogether, Adam lived
930 years, and then he died.
6When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father
i of Enosh. 7And after he became the father of
Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and
daughters. 8Altogether, Seth lived 912 years, and then he
died.
9When Enosh had lived 90 years, he became the father
of Kenan. 10And after he became the father of Kenan,
Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and
daughters. 11Altogether, Enosh lived 905 years, and then
he died.
12When Kenan had lived 70 years, he became the father
of Mahalalel. 13And after he became the father of
Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons
and daughters. 14Altogether, Kenan lived 910 years, and
then he died.
15When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the
father of Jared. 16And after he became the father of Jared,
Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and
daughters. 17Altogether, Mahalalel lived 895 years, and
then he died.
18When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father
of Enoch. 19And after he became the father of
Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and
daughters. 20Altogether, Jared lived 962 years, and then
he died.
21When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father
of Methuselah. 22And after he became the father of
Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and had
other sons and daughters. 23Altogether, Enoch lived 365
years. 24Enoch walked with God; then he was no more,
because God took him away.
25When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became
the father of Lamech. 26And after he became the father
of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other
sons and daughters. 27Altogether, Methuselah lived 969
years, and then he died.
28When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son.
29He named him Noah j and said, He will comfort us in
the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the
ground the LORD has cursed. 30After Noah was born,
Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters.
31Altogether, Lamech lived 777 years, and then he
died.
32After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father
of Shem, Ham and Japheth.
The Flood
6 When men began to increase in number on the
earth and daughters were born to them, 2the sons of
God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and
they married any of them they chose. 3Then the LORD
said, My Spirit will not contend with k man forever, for
he is mortal l; his days will be a hundred and twenty
years.
4The Nephilim were on the earth in those days
and also afterwardwhen the sons of God went to the
daughters of men and had children by them. They were
the heroes of old, men of renown.
5The LORD saw how great mans wickedness on the
earth had become, and that every inclination of the
thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. 6The
LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth,
and his heart was filled with pain. 7So the LORD said, I
will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face
of the earthmen and animals, and creatures that
move along the ground, and birds of the airfor I am
grieved that I have made them. 8But Noah found favor
in the eyes of the LORD.
9This is the account of Noah.
Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the
GENESIS 6:9 3
a 8 Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac; Masoretic Text does not have Lets go out to the field. b 15 Septuagint,
Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew Very well c 16 Nod means wandering (see verses 12 and 14). d 22 Or who instructed all who work in
e 23 Or I will kill f 25 Seth probably means granted. g 26 Or to proclaim h 2 Hebrew adam i 6 Father may mean ancestor; also
in verses 726. j 29 Noah sounds like the Hebrew for comfort. k 3 Or My spirit will not remain in l 3 Or corrupt
people of his time, and he walked with God. 10Noah had
three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.
11Now the earth was corrupt in Gods sight and was
full of violence. 12God saw how corrupt the earth had
become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their
ways. 13So God said to Noah, I am going to put an end
to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because
of them. I am surely going to destroy both them
and the earth. 14So make yourself an ark of cypress a
wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside
and out. 15This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be
450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high. b 16Make a
roof for it and finish c the ark to within 18 inches d of the
top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower,
middle and upper decks. 17I am going to bring floodwaters
on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens,
every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything
on earth will perish. 18But I will establish my covenant
with you, and you will enter the arkyou and
your sons and your wife and your sons wives with you.
19You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures,
male and female, to keep them alive with you. 20Two of
every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every
kind of creature that moves along the ground will come
to you to be kept alive. 21You are to take every kind of
food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you
and for them.
22Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
7 The LORD then said to Noah, Go into the ark, you
and your whole family, because I have found you
righteous in this generation. 2Take with you seven e of
every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and
two of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its
mate, 3and also seven of every kind of bird, male and female,
to keep their various kinds alive throughout the
earth. 4Seven days from now I will send rain on the
earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe
from the face of the earth every living creature I have
made.
5And Noah did all that the LORD commanded him.
6Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters
came on the earth. 7And Noah and his sons and his
wife and his sons wives entered the ark to escape the
waters of the flood. 8Pairs of clean and unclean animals,
of birds and of all creatures that move along the
ground, 9male and female, came to Noah and entered
the ark, as God had commanded Noah. 10And after the
seven days the floodwaters came on the earth.
11In the six hundredth year of Noahs life, on the seventeenth
day of the second monthon that day all the
springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates
of the heavens were opened. 12And rain fell on the earth
forty days and forty nights.
13On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham
and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his
three sons, entered the ark. 14They had with them every
wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according
to their kinds, every creature that moves along the
ground according to its kind and every bird according to
its kind, everything with wings. 15Pairs of all creatures
that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and
entered the ark. 16The animals going in were male and
female of every living thing, as God had commanded
Noah. Then the LORD shut him in.
17For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth,
and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high
above the earth. 18The waters rose and increased
greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface
of the water. 19They rose greatly on the earth, and all
the high mountains under the entire heavens were
covered. 20The waters rose and covered the mountains
to a depth of more than twenty feet. f, g 21Every living
thing that moved on the earth perishedbirds, livestock,
wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over
the earth, and all mankind. 22Everything on dry land
that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. 23Every
living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out;
men and animals and the creatures that move along
the ground and the birds of the air were wiped from
the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in
the ark.
24The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty
days.
8 But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals
and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and
he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.
2Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the
heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling
from the sky. 3The water receded steadily from the
earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water
had gone down, 4and on the seventeenth day of the
seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of
Ararat. 5The waters continued to recede until the tenth
month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops
of the mountains became visible.
6After forty days Noah opened the window he had
made in the ark 7and sent out a raven, and it kept flying
back and forth until the water had dried up from
the earth. 8Then he sent out a dove to see if the water
had receded from the surface of the ground. 9But the
dove could find no place to set its feet because there
was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned
to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand
and took the dove and brought it back to himself in
the ark. 10He waited seven more days and again sent
out the dove from the ark. 11When the dove returned to
him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly
plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had
receded from the earth. 12He waited seven more days
and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return
to him.
13By the first day of the first month of Noahs six
hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the
earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark
and saw that the surface of the ground was dry. 14By the
twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was
completely dry.
15Then God said to Noah, 16Come out of the ark,
you and your wife and your sons and their wives.
17Bring out every kind of living creature that is with
youthe birds, the animals, and all the creatures that
move along the groundso they can multiply on the
earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it.
18So Noah came out, together with his sons and his
wife and his sons wives. 19All the animals and all the
creatures that move along the ground and all the
birdseverything that moves on the earthcame out
of the ark, one kind after another.
20Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and, taking
some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed
burnt offerings on it. 21The LORD smelled the
pleasing aroma and said in his heart: Never again will I
curse the ground because of man, even though h every
inclination of his heart is evil from childhood. And never
again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.

Gods Covenant With Noah
9 Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to
them, Be fruitful and increase in number and fill
the earth. 2The fear and dread of you will fall upon all
the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air, upon
every creature that moves along the ground, and upon
all the fish of the sea; they are given into your hands.
3Everything that lives and moves will be food for you.
Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.
4But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood
still in it. 5And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an
accounting. I will demand an accounting from every
animal. And from each man, too, I will demand an accounting
for the life of his fellow man.
6 Whoever sheds the blood of man,
by man shall his blood be shed;
for in the image of God
has God made man.
7As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply
on the earth and increase upon it.
8Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: 9I
now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants
after you 10and with every living creature
that was with youthe birds, the livestock and all the
wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with
youevery living creature on earth. 11I establish my
covenant with you: Never again will all life be cut off by
the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to
destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the sign of the covenant I am
making between me and you and every living creature
with you, a covenant for all generations to come: 13I
have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the
sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
14Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow
appears in the clouds, 15I will remember my covenant
between me and you and all living creatures of
every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood
to destroy all life. 16Whenever the rainbow appears in
the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting
covenant between God and all living creatures of every
kind on the earth.
17So God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant
I have established between me and all life on the
earth.
The Sons of Noah
18The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were
Shem, Ham and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)
19These were the three sons of Noah, and from
them came the people who were scattered over the
earth.
20Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded a to plant a
vineyard. 21When he drank some of its wine, he became
drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent. 22Ham, the father
of Canaan, saw his fathers nakedness and told his
two brothers outside. 23But Shem and Japheth took a
garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they
walked in backward and covered their fathers nakedness.
Their faces were turned the other way so that they
would not see their fathers nakedness.
24When Noah awoke from his wine and found out
what his youngest son had done to him, 25he said,
Cursed be Canaan!
The lowest of slaves
will he be to his brothers.
26He also said,
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem!
May Canaan be the slave of Shem. b
27May God extend the territory of Japheth c;
may Japheth live in the tents of Shem,
and may Canaan be his d slave.
28After the flood Noah lived 350 years. 29Altogether,
Noah lived 950 years, and then he died.
The Table of Nations
10 This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth,
Noahs sons, who themselves had sons after the
flood.
The Japhethites
2 The sons e of Japheth:
Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech
and Tiras.
3 The sons of Gomer:
Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah.
4 The sons of Javan:
Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittim and the Rodanim. f
5(From these the maritime peoples spread out
into their territories by their clans within their
nations, each with its own language.)
The Hamites
6 The sons of Ham:
Cush, Mizraim, g Put and Canaan.
7 The sons of Cush:
Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteca.
The sons of Raamah:
Sheba and Dedan.
8Cush was the father h of Nimrod, who grew to be a
mighty warrior on the earth. 9He was a mighty hunter
before the LORD; that is why it is said, Like Nimrod, a
mighty hunter before the LORD. 10The first centers of his
kingdom were Babylon, Erech, Akkad and Calneh, in i
Shinar. j 11From that land he went to Assyria, where he
built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, k Calah 12and Resen, which is
between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
13Mizraim was the father of
the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,
14Pathrusites, Casluhites (from whom the Philistines
came) and Caphtorites.
15Canaan was the father of
Sidon his firstborn, l and of the Hittites, 16Jebusites,
Amorites, Girgashites, 17Hivites, Arkites,
Sinites, 18Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites.
Later the Canaanite clans scattered 19and the borders
of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far
as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah
and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
20These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages,
in their territories and nations.
The Semites
21Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother
was m Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of
Eber.
GENESIS 10:21 5
a 20 Or soil, was the first b 26 Or be his slave c 27 Japheth sounds like the Hebrew for extend. d 27 Or their e 2 Sons may mean
descendants or successors or nations; also in verses 3, 4, 6, 7, 2023, 29 and 31. f 4 Some manuscripts of the Masoretic Text and
Samaritan Pentateuch (see also Septuagint and 1 Chron. 1:7); most manuscripts of the Masoretic Text Dodanim g 6 That is, Egypt; also
in verse 13 h 8 Father may mean ancestor or predecessor or founder; also in verses 13, 15, 24 and 26. i 10 Or Erech and Akkadall of

older brother of
22The sons of Shem:
Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram.
23 The sons of Aram:
Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshech. a
24 Arphaxad was the father of b Shelah,
and Shelah the father of Eber.
25 Two sons were born to Eber:
One was named Peleg, c because in his time the
earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan.
26 Joktan was the father of
Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 27Hadoram,
Uzal, Diklah, 28Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
29Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons
of Joktan.
30The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward
Sephar, in the eastern hill country.
31These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages,
in their territories and nations.
32These are the clans of Noahs sons, according to
their lines of descent, within their nations. From these
the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.
The Tower of Babel
11 Now the whole world had one language and a
common speech. 2As men moved eastward, d they
found a plain in Shinar e and settled there.
3They said to each other, Come, lets make bricks
and bake them thoroughly. They used brick instead of
stone, and tar for mortar. 4Then they said, Come, let us
build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the
heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves
and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.
5But the LORD came down to see the city and the
tower that the men were building. 6The LORD said, If as
one people speaking the same language they have begun
to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible
for them. 7Come, let us go down and confuse
their language so they will not understand each other.
8So the LORD scattered them from there over all the
earth, and they stopped building the city. 9That is why it
was called Babel fbecause there the LORD confused
the language of the whole world. From there the LORD
scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
From Shem to Abram
10This is the account of Shem.
Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years
old, he became the father g of Arphaxad. 11And after he
became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years
and had other sons and daughters.
12When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the
father of Shelah. 13And after he became the father of
Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons
and daughters. h
14When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father
of Eber. 15And after he became the father of Eber,
Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
16When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father
of Peleg. 17And after he became the father of Peleg,
Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
18When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father
of Reu. 19And after he became the father of Reu,
Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
20When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father
of Serug. 21And after he became the father of Serug, Reu
lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
22When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father
of Nahor. 23And after he became the father of Nahor,
Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and
daughters.
24When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father
of Terah. 25And after he became the father of Terah,
Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
26After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father
of Abram, Nahor and Haran.
27This is the account of Terah.
Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.
And Haran became the father of Lot. 28While his
father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans,
in the land of his birth. 29Abram and Nahor both
married. The name of Abrams wife was Sarai, and the
name of Nahors wife was Milcah; she was the daughter
of Haran, the father of both Milcah and Iscah. 30Now
Sarai was barren; she had no children.
31Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of
Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his
son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the
Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Haran,
they settled there.
32Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Haran.
The Call of Abram
12 The LORD had said to Abram, Leave your country,
your people and your fathers household and go
to the land I will show you.
2 I will make you into a great nation
and I will bless you;
I will make your name great,
and you will be a blessing.
3 I will bless those who bless you,
and whoever curses you I will curse;
and all peoples on earth
will be blessed through you.
4So Abram left, as the LORD had told him; and Lot
went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when
he set out from Haran. 5He took his wife Sarai, his
nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated
and the people they had acquired in Haran, and they set
out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there.
6Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of
the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites
were in the land. 7The LORD appeared to
Abram and said, To your offspring i I will give this
land. So he built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared
to him.
8From there he went on toward the hills east of
Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west
and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the LORD
and called on the name of the LORD. 9Then Abram set
out and continued toward the Negev.
Abram in Egypt
10Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram
went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the
famine was severe. 11As he was about to enter Egypt, he
said to his wife Sarai, I know what a beautiful woman
you are. 12When the Egyptians see you, they will say,
This is his wife. Then they will kill me but will let you
6 GENESIS 10:22
a 23 See Septuagint and 1 Chron. 1:17; Hebrew Mash b 24 Hebrew; Septuagint father of Cainan, and Cainan was the father of
c 25 Peleg means division. d 2 Or from the east; or in the east e 2 That is, Babylonia f 9 That is, Babylon; Babel sounds like the
Hebrew for confused. g 10 Father may mean ancestor; also in verses 1125. h 12,13 Hebrew; Septuagint (see also Luke 3:35, 36 and
note at Gen. 10:24) 35 years, he became the father of Cainan. 13And after he became the father of Cainan, Arphaxad lived 430 years and had
other sons and daughters, and then he died.When Cainan had lived 130 years, he became the father of Shelah. And after he became the
father of Shelah, Cainan lived 330 years and had other sons and daughters i 7 Or seed
live. 13Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well
for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.
14When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw
that she was a very beautiful woman. 15And when Pharaohs
officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and
she was taken into his palace. 16He treated Abram well
for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle,
male and female donkeys, menservants and maidservants,
and camels.
17But the LORD inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh
and his household because of Abrams wife Sarai. 18So
Pharaoh summoned Abram. What have you done to
me? he said. Why didnt you tell me she was your
wife? 19Why did you say, She is my sister, so that I took
her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her
and go! 20Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to
his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife
and everything he had.
Abram and Lot Separate
13 So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with
his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with
him. 2Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and
in silver and gold.
3From the Negev he went from place to place until
he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai
where his tent had been earlier 4and where he had first
built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the
LORD.
5Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also
had flocks and herds and tents. 6But the land could not
support them while they stayed together, for their possessions
were so great that they were not able to stay together.
7And quarreling arose between Abrams herdsmen
and the herdsmen of Lot. The Canaanites and
Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.
8So Abram said to Lot, Lets not have any quarreling
between you and me, or between your herdsmen and
mine, for we are brothers. 9Is not the whole land before
you? Lets part company. If you go to the left, Ill go to
the right; if you go to the right, Ill go to the left.
10Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the
Jordan was well watered, like the garden of the LORD,
like the land of Egypt, toward Zoar. (This was before the
LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) 11So Lot chose
for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward
the east. The two men parted company: 12Abram
lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the
cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.
13Now the men of Sodom were wicked and were sinning
greatly against the LORD.
14The LORD said to Abram after Lot had parted from
him, Lift up your eyes from where you are and look
north and south, east and west. 15All the land that you
see I will give to you and your offspring a forever. 16I will
make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if
anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could
be counted. 17Go, walk through the length and breadth
of the land, for I am giving it to you.
18So Abram moved his tents and went to live near
the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an
altar to the LORD.
Abram Rescues Lot
14 At this time Amraphel king of Shinar, b Arioch king
of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal
king of Goiim 2went to war against Bera king of Sodom,
Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber
king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is,
Zoar). 3All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of
Siddim (the Salt Sea c). 4For twelve years they had been
subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they
rebelled.
5In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings
allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in
Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in
Shaveh Kiriathaim 6and the Horites in the hill country
of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert. 7Then they
turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh),
and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites,
as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazazon
Tamar.
8Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the
king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela
(that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle
lines in the Valley of Siddim 9against Kedorlaomer king
of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar
and Arioch king of Ellasarfour kings against five.
10Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when
the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the
men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills. 11The
four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah
and all their food; then they went away. 12They also carried
off Abrams nephew Lot and his possessions, since
he was living in Sodom.
13One who had escaped came and reported this to
Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the
great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother d of Eshcol
and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram. 14When
Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he
called out the 318 trained men born in his household
and went in pursuit as far as Dan. 15During the night
Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed
them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.
16He recovered all the goods and brought back his
relative Lot and his possessions, together with the
women and the other people.
17After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer
and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came
out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the
Kings Valley).
18Then Melchizedek king of Salem e brought out
bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, 19and
he blessed Abram, saying,
Blessed be Abram by God Most High,
Creator f of heaven and earth.
20 And blessed be g God Most High,
who delivered your enemies into your hand.
Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
21The king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the
people and keep the goods for yourself.
22But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have
raised my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of
heaven and earth, and have taken an oath 23that I will
accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or
the thong of a sandal, so that you will never be able to
say, I made Abram rich. 24I will accept nothing but
what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to
the men who went with meto Aner, Eshcol and Mamre.
Let them have their share.
Gods Covenant With Abram
15 After this, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a
vision:
Do not be afraid, Abram.
I am your shield, h
your very great reward. i
2But Abram said, O Sovereign LORD, what can you
GENESIS 15:2 7
a 15 Or seed; also in verse 16 b 1 That is, Babylonia; also in verse 9 c 3 That is, the Dead Sea d 13 Or a relative; or an ally
e 18 That is, Jerusalem f 19 Or Possessor; also in verse 22 g 20 Or And praise be to h 1 Or sovereign i 1 Or shield; / your reward
will be very great
give me since I remain childless and the one who will
inherit a my estate is Eliezer of Damascus? 3And Abram
said, You have given me no children; so a servant in
my household will be my heir.
4Then the word of the LORD came to him: This man
will not be your heir, but a son coming from your own
body will be your heir. 5He took him outside and said,
Look up at the heavens and count the starsif indeed
you can count them. Then he said to him, So shall
your offspring be.
6Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him
as righteousness.
7He also said to him, I am the LORD, who brought
you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to
take possession of it.
8But Abram said, O Sovereign LORD, how can I know
that I will gain possession of it?
9So the LORD said to him, Bring me a heifer, a goat
and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a
young pigeon.
10Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two
and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds,
however, he did not cut in half. 11Then birds of prey
came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them
away.
12As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep
sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over
him. 13Then the LORD said to him, Know for certain
that your descendants will be strangers in a country not
their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated
four hundred years. 14But I will punish the nation they
serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with
great possessions. 15You, however, will go to your fathers
in peace and be buried at a good old age. 16In the
fourth generation your descendants will come back
here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its
full measure.
17When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a
smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and
passed between the pieces. 18On that day the LORD
made a covenant with Abram and said, To your descendants
I give this land, from the river b of Egypt to the
great river, the Euphrates 19the land of the Kenites,

Hagar and Ishmael
16 Now Sarai, Abrams wife, had borne him no children.
But she had an Egyptian maidservant
named Hagar; 2so she said to Abram, The LORD has
kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant;
perhaps I can build a family through her.
Abram agreed to what Sarai said. 3So after Abram
had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took
her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to her
husband to be his wife. 4He slept with Hagar, and she
conceived.
When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise
her mistress. 5Then Sarai said to Abram, You are
responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant
in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant,
she despises me. May the LORD judge between
you and me.
6Your servant is in your hands, Abram said. Do
with her whatever you think best. Then Sarai mistreated
Hagar; so she fled from her.
7The angel of the LORD found Hagar near a spring in
the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to
Shur. 8And he said, Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have
you come from, and where are you going?
Im running away from my mistress Sarai, she answered.
9Then the angel of the LORD told her, Go back to
your mistress and submit to her. 10The angel added, I
will so increase your descendants that they will be too
numerous to count.
11The angel of the LORD also said to her:
You are now with child
and you will have a son.
You shall name him Ishmael, c
for the LORD has heard of your misery.
12He will be a wild donkey of a man;
his hand will be against everyone
and everyones hand against him,
and he will live in hostility
toward d all his brothers.
13She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her:
You are the God who sees me, for she said, I have
now seen e the One who sees me. 14That is why the well
was called Beer Lahai Roi f; it is still there, between Kadesh
and Bered.
15So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the
name Ishmael to the son she had borne. 16Abram was
eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
The Covenant of Circumcision
17 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD
appeared to him and said, I am God Almighty g;
walk before me and be blameless. 2I will confirm my
covenant between me and you and will greatly increase
your numbers.
3Abram fell facedown, and God said to him, 4As for
me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father
of many nations. 5No longer will you be called Abramh;
your name will be Abraham, i for I have made you a father
of many nations. 6I will make you very fruitful; I
will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.
7I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant
between me and you and your descendants after you for
the generations to come, to be your God and the God of
your descendants after you. 8The whole land of Canaan,
where you are now an alien, I will give as an everlasting
possession to you and your descendants after
you; and I will be their God.
9Then God said to Abraham, As for you, you must
keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you
for the generations to come. 10This is my covenant with
you and your descendants after you, the covenant you
are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
11You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be
the sign of the covenant between me and you. 12For the
generations to come every male among you who is
eight days old must be circumcised, including those
born in your household or bought with money from a
foreignerthose who are not your offspring. 13Whether
born in your household or bought with your money,
they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is
to be an everlasting covenant. 14Any uncircumcised
male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be
cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.
15God also said to Abraham, As for Sarai your wife,
you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.
16I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her.
I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations;
kings of peoples will come from her.
17Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to
himself, Will a son be born to a man a hundred years
old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety? 18And
8 GENESIS 15:3
a 2 The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain. b 18 Or Wadi c 11 Ishmael means God hears. d 12 Or live to the east /
of e 13 Or seen the back of f 14 Beer Lahai Roi means well of the Living One who sees me. g 1 Hebrew El-Shaddai h5 Abram
means exalted father. i 5 Abraham means father of many.
Abraham said to God, If only Ishmael might live under
your blessing!
19Then God said, Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear
you a son, and you will call him Isaac. a I will establish
my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for
his descendants after him. 20And as for Ishmael, I have
heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful
and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the
father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great
nation. 21But my covenant I will establish with Isaac,
whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.
22When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God
went up from him.
23On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael
and all those born in his household or bought with his
money, every male in his household, and circumcised
them, as God told him. 24Abraham was ninety-nine
years old when he was circumcised, 25and his son Ishmael
was thirteen; 26Abraham and his son Ishmael
were both circumcised on that same day. 27And every
male in Abrahams household, including those born in
his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised
with him.
The Three Visitors
18 The LORD appeared to Abraham near the great
trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance
to his tent in the heat of the day. 2Abraham
looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he
saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to
meet them and bowed low to the ground.
3He said, If I have found favor in your eyes, my
lord, b do not pass your servant by. 4Let a little water be
brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest
under this tree. 5Let me get you something to eat, so
you can be refreshed and then go on your waynow
that you have come to your servant.
Very well, they answered, do as you say.
6So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. Quick,
he said, get three seahs c of fine flour and knead it and
bake some bread.
7Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender
calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare
it. 8He then brought some curds and milk and the calf
that had been prepared, and set these before them.
While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.
9Where is your wife Sarah? they asked him.
There, in the tent, he said.
10Then the LORD d said, I will surely return to you
about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have
a son.
Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent,
which was behind him. 11Abraham and Sarah were already
old and well advanced in years, and Sarah was
past the age of childbearing. 12So Sarah laughed to herself
as she thought, After I am worn out and my master e
is old, will I now have this pleasure?
13Then the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah
laugh and say, Will I really have a child, now that I am
old? 14Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will return to
you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have
a son.
15Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, I did not
laugh.
But he said, Yes, you did laugh.
Abraham Pleads for Sodom
16When the men got up to leave, they looked down
toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them
to see them on their way. 17Then the LORD said, Shall I
hide from Abraham what I am about to do? 18Abraham
will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all
nations on earth will be blessed through him. 19For I
have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and
his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by
doing what is right and just, so that the LORD will bring
about for Abraham what he has promised him.
20Then the LORD said, The outcry against Sodom
and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous
21that I will go down and see if what they have done is as
bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will
know.
22The men turned away and went toward Sodom,
but Abraham remained standing before the LORD. f
23Then Abraham approached him and said: Will you
sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 24What if
there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you
really sweep it away and not spare g the place for the
sake of the fifty righteous people in it? 25Far be it from
you to do such a thingto kill the righteous with the
wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far
be it from you! Will not the Judge h of all the earth do
right?
26The LORD said, If I find fifty righteous people in
the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their
sake.
27Then Abraham spoke up again: Now that I have
been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing
but dust and ashes, 28what if the number of the
righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the
whole city because of five people?
If I find forty-five there, he said, I will not destroy
it.
29Once again he spoke to him, What if only forty
are found there?
He said, For the sake of forty, I will not do it.
30Then he said, May the Lord not be angry, but let
me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?
He answered, I will not do it if I find thirty there.
31Abraham said, Now that I have been so bold as to
speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found
there?
He said, For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.
32Then he said, May the Lord not be angry, but let
me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found
there?
He answered, For the sake of ten, I will not destroy
it.
33When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham,
he left, and Abraham returned home.
Sodom and Gomorrah Destroyed
19 The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening,
and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city.
When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed
down with his face to the ground. 2My lords, he said,
please turn aside to your servants house. You can
wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your
way early in the morning.
No, they answered, we will spend the night in the
square.
3But he insisted so strongly that they did go with
him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for
them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. 4Before
they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the
city of Sodomboth young and oldsurrounded the
house. 5They called to Lot, Where are the men who
came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we
can have sex with them.
6Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door
GENESIS 19:6 9
a 19 Isaac means he laughs. b 3 Or O Lord c 6 That is, probably about 20 quarts (about 22 liters) d 10 Hebrew Then he e 12 Or
husband f 22 Masoretic Text; an ancient Hebrew scribal tradition but the LORD remained standing before Abraham g 24 Or forgive;
also in verse 26 h 25 Or Ruler
behind him 7and said, No, my friends. Dont do this
wicked thing. 8Look, I have two daughters who have
never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you,
and you can do what you like with them. But dont do
anything to these men, for they have come under the
protection of my roof.
9Get out of our way, they replied. And they said,
This fellow came here as an alien, and now he wants to
play the judge! Well treat you worse than them. They
kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to
break down the door.
10But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot
back into the house and shut the door. 11Then they
struck the men who were at the door of the house,
young and old, with blindness so that they could not
find the door.
12The two men said to Lot, Do you have anyone
else heresons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone
else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of
here, 13because we are going to destroy this place. The
outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he
has sent us to destroy it.
14So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who
were pledged to marry a his daughters. He said, Hurry
and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to
destroy the city! But his sons-in-law thought he was
joking.
15With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot,
saying, Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters
who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is
punished.
16When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and
the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led
them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to
them. 17As soon as they had brought them out, one of
them said, Flee for your lives! Dont look back, and
dont stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains
or you will be swept away!
18But Lot said to them, No, my lords, b please!
19Your c servant has found favor in your c eyes, and you c
have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But
I cant flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake
me, and Ill die. 20Look, here is a town near enough to
run to, and it is small. Let me flee to itit is very small,
isnt it? Then my life will be spared.
21He said to him, Very well, I will grant this request
too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. 22But
flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until
you reach it. (That is why the town was called Zoar. d)
23By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen
over the land. 24Then the LORD rained down burning
sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrahfrom the LORD out of
the heavens. 25Thus he overthrew those cities and the
entire plain, including all those living in the citiesand
also the vegetation in the land. 26But Lots wife looked
back, and she became a pillar of salt.
27Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned
to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
28He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward
all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke
rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.
29So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he
remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the
catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had
lived.
Lot and His Daughters
30Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in
the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and
his two daughters lived in a cave. 31One day the older
daughter said to the younger, Our father is old, and
there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom
all over the earth. 32Lets get our father to drink
wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line
through our father.
33That night they got their father to drink wine, and
the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was
not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
34The next day the older daughter said to the younger,
Last night I lay with my father. Lets get him to
drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with
him so we can preserve our family line through our father.
35So they got their father to drink wine that night
also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him.
Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or
when she got up.
36So both of Lots daughters became pregnant by
their father. 37The older daughter had a son, and she
named him Moab e; he is the father of the Moabites of
today. 38The younger daughter also had a son, and she
named him Ben-Ammi f; he is the father of the Ammonites
of today.
Abraham and Abimelech
20 Now Abraham moved on from there into the region
of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and
Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar, 2and there Abraham
said of his wife Sarah, She is my sister. Then
Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.
3But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night
and said to him, You are as good as dead because of the
woman you have taken; she is a married woman.
4Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he said,
Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation? 5Did he not
say to me, She is my sister, and didnt she also say, He
is my brother? I have done this with a clear conscience
and clean hands.
6Then God said to him in the dream, Yes, I know
you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept
you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let
you touch her. 7Now return the mans wife, for he is a
prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if
you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all
yours will die.
8Early the next morning Abimelech summoned all
his officials, and when he told them all that had happened,
they were very much afraid. 9Then Abimelech
called Abraham in and said, What have you done to
us? How have I wronged you that you have brought
such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have
done things to me that should not be done. 10And
Abimelech asked Abraham, What was your reason for
doing this?
11Abraham replied, I said to myself, There is surely
no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because
of my wife. 12Besides, she really is my sister, the
daughter of my father though not of my mother; and
she became my wife. 13And when God had me wander
from my fathers household, I said to her, This is how
you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of
me, He is my brother.  
14Then Abimelech brought sheep and cattle and
male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and
he returned Sarah his wife to him. 15And Abimelech
said, My land is before you; live wherever you like.
16To Sarah he said, I am giving your brother a thousand
shekels g of silver. This is to cover the offense
against you before all who are with you; you are completely
vindicated.
17Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed
Abimelech, his wife and his slave girls so they could
have children again, 18for the LORD had closed up every
10 GENESIS 19:7
a 14 Or were married to b 18 Or No, Lord; or No, my lord c 19 The Hebrew is singular. d 22 Zoar means small. e 37 Moab sounds
like the Hebrew for from father. f 38 Ben-Ammi means son of my people. g 16 That is, about 25 pounds (about 11.5 kilograms)
womb in Abimelechs household because of Abrahams
wife Sarah.
The Birth of Isaac
21 Now the LORD was gracious to Sarah as he had
said, and the LORD did for Sarah what he had
promised. 2Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to
Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised
him. 3Abraham gave the name Isaac a to the son
Sarah bore him. 4When his son Isaac was eight days old,
Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him.
5Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac
was born to him.
6Sarah said, God has brought me laughter, and everyone
who hears about this will laugh with me. 7And
she added, Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah
would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in
his old age.
Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away
8The child grew and was weaned, and on the day
Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast. 9But Sarah
saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had
borne to Abraham was mocking, 10and she said to Abraham,
Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that
slave womans son will never share in the inheritance
with my son Isaac.
11The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it
concerned his son. 12But God said to him, Do not be so
distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen
to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac
that your offspring b will be reckoned. 13I will make the
son of the maidservant into a nation also, because he is
your offspring.
14Early the next morning Abraham took some food
and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set
them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the
boy. She went on her way and wandered in the desert of
Beersheba.
15When the water in the skin was gone, she put the
boy under one of the bushes. 16Then she went off and
sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she
thought, I cannot watch the boy die. And as she sat
there nearby, she c began to sob.
17God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God
called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, What is
the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the
boy crying as he lies there. 18Lift the boy up and take
him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.
19Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of
water. So she went and filled the skin with water and
gave the boy a drink.
20God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the
desert and became an archer. 21While he was living in
the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from
Egypt.
The Treaty at Beersheba
22At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander
of his forces said to Abraham, God is with you in everything
you do. 23Now swear to me here before God
that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or
my descendants. Show to me and the country where
you are living as an alien the same kindness I have
shown to you.
24Abraham said, I swear it.
25Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a
well of water that Abimelechs servants had seized.
26But Abimelech said, I dont know who has done this.
You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today.
27So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave
them to Abimelech, and the two men made a treaty.
28Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock,
29and Abimelech asked Abraham, What is the meaning
of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?
30He replied, Accept these seven lambs from my
hand as a witness that I dug this well.
31So that place was called Beersheba, d because the
two men swore an oath there.
32After the treaty had been made at Beersheba,
Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces returned
to the land of the Philistines. 33Abraham planted
a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon
the name of the LORD, the Eternal God. 34And Abraham
stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
Abraham Tested
22 Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to
him, Abraham!
Here I am, he replied.
2Then God said, Take your son, your only son,
Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah.
Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the
mountains I will tell you about.
3Early the next morning Abraham got up and saddled
his donkey. He took with him two of his servants
and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for
the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told
him about. 4On the third day Abraham looked up and
saw the place in the distance. 5He said to his servants,
Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over
there. We will worship and then we will come back to
you.
6Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and
placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the
fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together,
7Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, Father?
Yes, my son? Abraham replied.
The fire and wood are here, Isaac said, but where
is the lamb for the burnt offering?
8Abraham answered, God himself will provide the
lamb for the burnt offering, my son. And the two of
them went on together.
9When they reached the place God had told him
about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the
wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the
altar, on top of the wood. 10Then he reached out his
hand and took the knife to slay his son. 11But the angel
of the LORD called out to him from heaven, Abraham!
Abraham!
Here I am, he replied.
12Do not lay a hand on the boy, he said. Do not do
anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because
you have not withheld from me your son, your
only son.
13Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a
rame caught by its horns. He went over and took the
ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his
son. 14So Abraham called that place The LORDWill Provide.
And to this day it is said, On the mountain of the
LORD it will be provided.
15The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from
heaven a second time 16and said, I swear by myself,
declares the LORD, that because you have done this and
have not withheld your son, your only son, 17I will surely
bless you and make your descendants as numerous
GENESIS 22:17 11
a 3 Isaac means he laughs. b 12 Or seed c 16 Hebrew; Septuagint the child d 31 Beersheba can mean well of seven or well of the
oath. e 13 Many manuscripts of the Masoretic Text, Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint and Syriac; most manuscripts of the Masoretic
Text a ram behind him
as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore.
Your descendants will take possession of the cities of
their enemies, 18and through your offspring a all nations
on earth will be blessed, because you have
obeyed me.
19Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they
set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in
Beersheba.
Nahors Sons
20Some time later Abraham was told, Milcah is also
a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor:
21Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of
Aram), 22Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.
23Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah bore
these eight sons to Abrahams brother Nahor. 24His concubine,
whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah,
Gaham, Tahash and Maacah.
The Death of Sarah
23 Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven
years old. 2She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron)
in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to
mourn for Sarah and to weep over her.
3Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and
spoke to the Hittites. b He said, 4I am an alien and a
stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial
site here so I can bury my dead.
5The Hittites replied to Abraham, 6Sir, listen to us.
You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in
the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you
his tomb for burying your dead.
7Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the
people of the land, the Hittites. 8He said to them, If you
are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me
and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf
9so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs
to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell
it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.
10Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people
and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites
who had come to the gate of his city. 11No, my
lord, he said. Listen to me; I give c you the field, and I
give c you the cave that is in it. I give c it to you in the
presence of my people. Bury your dead.
12Again Abraham bowed down before the people of
the land 13and he said to Ephron in their hearing, Listen
to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept
it from me so I can bury my dead there.
14Ephron answered Abraham, 15Listen to me, my
lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels d of silver,
but what is that between me and you? Bury your dead.
16Abraham agreed to Ephrons terms and weighed
out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the
Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the
weight current among the merchants.
17So Ephrons field in Machpelah near Mamreboth
the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the
borders of the fieldwas deeded 18to Abraham as his
property in the presence of all the Hittites who had
come to the gate of the city. 19Afterward Abraham buried
his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah
near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
20So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham
by the Hittites as a burial site.
Isaac and Rebekah
24 Abraham was now old and well advanced in
years, and the LORD had blessed him in every way.
2He said to the chief e servant in his household, the one
in charge of all that he had, Put your hand under my
thigh. 3I want you to swear by the LORD, the God of
heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife
for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites,
among whom I am living, 4but will go to my country
and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.
5The servant asked him, What if the woman is unwilling
to come back with me to this land? Shall I then
take your son back to the country you came from?
6Make sure that you do not take my son back
there, Abraham said. 7The LORD, the God of heaven,
who brought me out of my fathers household and my
native land and who spoke to me and promised me on
oath, saying, To your offspring a I will give this landhe
will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife
for my son from there. 8If the woman is unwilling to
come back with you, then you will be released from this
oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there. 9So
the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master
Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this
matter.
10Then the servant took ten of his masters camels
and left, taking with him all kinds of good things from
his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim f and made his
way to the town of Nahor. 11He had the camels kneel
down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening,
the time the women go out to draw water.
12Then he prayed, O LORD, God of my master Abraham,
give me success today, and show kindness to my
master Abraham. 13See, I am standing beside this
spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming
out to draw water. 14May it be that when I say to a
girl, Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,
and she says, Drink, and Ill water your camels toolet
her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac.
By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my
master.
15Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out
with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of
Bethuel son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abrahams
brother Nahor. 16The girl was very beautiful, a virgin;
no man had ever lain with her. She went down to the
spring, filled her jar and came up again.
17The servant hurried to meet her and said, Please
give me a little water from your jar.
18Drink, my lord, she said, and quickly lowered the
jar to her hands and gave him a drink.
19After she had given him a drink, she said, Ill draw
water for your camels too, until they have finished
drinking. 20So she quickly emptied her jar into the
trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and
drew enough for all his camels. 21Without saying a
word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or
not the LORD had made his journey successful.
22When the camels had finished drinking, the man
took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka g and two
gold bracelets weighing ten shekels. h 23Then he asked,
Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room
in your fathers house for us to spend the night?
24She answered him, I am the daughter of Bethuel,
the son that Milcah bore to Nahor. 25And she added,
We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for
you to spend the night.
26Then the man bowed down and worshiped the
LORD, 27saying, Praise be to the LORD, the God of my
master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness
and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has
led me on the journey to the house of my masters relatives.
28The girl ran and told her mothers household
12 GENESIS 22:18
a 18,7 Or seed b 3 Or the sons of Heth; also in verses 5, 7, 10, 16, 18 and 20 c 11 Or sell d 15 That is, about 10 pounds (about 4.5
kilograms) e 2 Or oldest f 10 That is, Northwest Mesopotamia g 22 That is, about 1/5 ounce (about 5.5 grams) h 22 That is,
about 4 ounces (about 110 grams)
about these things. 29Now Rebekah had a brother
named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the
spring. 30As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the
bracelets on his sisters arms, and had heard Rebekah
tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man
and found him standing by the camels near the spring.
31Come, you who are blessed by the LORD, he said.
Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the
house and a place for the camels.
32So the man went to the house, and the camels
were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the
camels, and water for him and his men to wash their
feet. 33Then food was set before him, but he said, I will
not eat until I have told you what I have to say.
Then tell us, Laban said.
34So he said, I am Abrahams servant. 35The LORD
has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become
wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and
gold, menservants and maidservants, and camels and
donkeys. 36My masters wife Sarah has borne him a son
in her a old age, and he has given him everything he
owns. 37And my master made me swear an oath, and
said, You must not get a wife for my son from the
daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, 38but
go to my fathers family and to my own clan, and get a
wife for my son.
39Then I asked my master, What if the woman will
not come back with me?
40He replied, The LORD, before whom I have
walked, will send his angel with you and make your
journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son
from my own clan and from my fathers family. 41Then,
when you go to my clan, you will be released from my
oath even if they refuse to give her to youyou will be
released from my oath.
42When I came to the spring today, I said, O LORD,
God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant
success to the journey on which I have come. 43See, I am
standing beside this spring; if a maiden comes out to
draw water and I say to her, Please let me drink a little
water from your jar, 44and if she says to me, Drink,
and Ill draw water for your camels too, let her be the
one the LORD has chosen for my masters son.
45Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah
came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down
to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, Please
give me a drink.
46She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder
and said, Drink, and Ill water your camels too. So I
drank, and she watered the camels also.
47I asked her, Whose daughter are you?
She said, The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor,
whom Milcah bore to him.
Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on
her arms, 48and I bowed down and worshiped the LORD.
I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who
had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of
my masters brother for his son. 49Now if you will show
kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if
not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.
50Laban and Bethuel answered, This is from the
LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.
51Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become
the wife of your masters son, as the LORD has directed.
52When Abrahams servant heard what they said, he
bowed down to the ground before the LORD. 53Then the
servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles
of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave
costly gifts to her brother and to her mother. 54Then he
and the men who were with him ate and drank and
spent the night there.
When they got up the next morning, he said, Send
me on my way to my master.
55But her brother and her mother replied, Let the
girl remain with us ten days or so; then you b may go.
56But he said to them, Do not detain me, now that
the LORD has granted success to my journey. Send me on
my way so I may go to my master.
57Then they said, Lets call the girl and ask her
about it. 58So they called Rebekah and asked her, Will
you go with this man?
I will go, she said.
59So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along
with her nurse and Abrahams servant and his men.
60And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,
Our sister, may you increase
to thousands upon thousands;
may your offspring possess
the gates of their enemies.
61Then Rebekah and her maids got ready and
mounted their camels and went back with the man. So
the servant took Rebekah and left.
62Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he
was living in the Negev. 63He went out to the field one
evening to meditate, c and as he looked up, he saw camels
approaching. 64Rebekah also looked up and saw
Isaac. She got down from her camel 65and asked the
servant, Who is that man in the field coming to
meet us?
He is my master, the servant answered. So she
took her veil and covered herself.
66Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.
67Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah,
and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and
he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mothers
death.
The Death of Abraham
25 Abraham took d another wife, whose name was
Keturah. 2She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan,
Midian, Ishbak and Shuah. 3Jokshan was the father of
Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the
Asshurites, the Letushites and the Leummites. 4The
sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida and
Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.
5Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac. 6But
while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his
concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to
the land of the east.
7Altogether, Abraham lived a hundred and seventyfive
years. 8Then Abraham breathed his last and died at
a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was
gathered to his people. 9His sons Isaac and Ishmael
buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in
the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, 10the field
Abraham had bought from the Hittites. e There Abraham
was buried with his wife Sarah. 11After Abrahams
death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near
Beer Lahai Roi.
Ishmaels Sons
12This is the account of Abrahams son Ishmael,
whom Sarahs maidservant, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to
Abraham.
13These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed
in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael,
Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 14Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
15Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.
16These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the
names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements
and camps. 17Altogether, Ishmael lived a hun-

dred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and
died, and he was gathered to his people. 18His descendants
settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the
border of Egypt, as you go toward Asshur. And they
lived in hostility toward a all their brothers.
Jacob and Esau
19This is the account of Abrahams son Isaac.
Abraham became the father of Isaac, 20and Isaac
was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter
of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aramb and sister
of Laban the Aramean.
21Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because
she was barren. The LORD answered his prayer,
and his wife Rebekah became pregnant. 22The babies
jostled each other within her, and she said, Why is this
happening to me? So she went to inquire of the LORD.
23The LORD said to her,
Two nations are in your womb,
and two peoples from within you will be
separated;
one people will be stronger than the other,
and the older will serve the younger.
24When the time came for her to give birth, there
were twin boys in her womb. 25The first to come out
was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so
they named him Esau. c 26After this, his brother came
out, with his hand grasping Esaus heel; so he was
named Jacob. d Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah
gave birth to them.
27The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful
hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was a
quiet man, staying among the tents. 28Isaac, who had a
taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
29Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau
came in from the open country, famished. 30He said to
Jacob, Quick, let me have some of that red stew! Im
famished! (That is why he was also called Edom. e)
31Jacob replied, First sell me your birthright.
32Look, I am about to die, Esau said. What good is
the birthright to me?
33But Jacob said, Swear to me first. So he swore an
oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.
34Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil
stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left.
So Esau despised his birthright.
Isaac and Abimelech
26 Now there was a famine in the landbesides the
earlier famine of Abrahams timeand Isaac
went to Abimelech king of the Philistines in Gerar. 2The
LORD appeared to Isaac and said, Do not go down to
Egypt; live in the land where I tell you to live. 3Stay in
this land for a while, and I will be with you and will
bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all
these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father
Abraham. 4I will make your descendants as numerous
as the stars in the sky and will give them all
these lands, and through your offspring f all nations on
earth will be blessed, 5because Abraham obeyed me
and kept my requirements, my commands, my decrees
and my laws. 6So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
7When the men of that place asked him about his
wife, he said, She is my sister, because he was afraid to
say, She is my wife. He thought, The men of this
place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because
she is beautiful.
8When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech
king of the Philistines looked down from a window and
saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. 9So Abimelech
summoned Isaac and said, She is really your wife! Why
did you say, She is my sister?
Isaac answered him, Because I thought I might lose
my life on account of her.
10Then Abimelech said, What is this you have done
to us? One of the men might well have slept with your
wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.
11So Abimelech gave orders to all the people: Anyone
who molests this man or his wife shall surely be put
to death.
12Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year
reaped a hundredfold, because the LORD blessed him.
13The man became rich, and his wealth continued to
grow until he became very wealthy. 14He had so many
flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied
him. 15So all the wells that his fathers servants had
dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines
stopped up, filling them with earth.
16Then Abimelech said to Isaac, Move away from
us; you have become too powerful for us.
17So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in
the Valley of Gerar and settled there. 18Isaac reopened
the wells that had been dug in the time of his father
Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after
Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his
father had given them.
19Isaacs servants dug in the valley and discovered a
well of fresh water there. 20But the herdsmen of Gerar
quarreled with Isaacs herdsmen and said, The water is
ours! So he named the well Esek, g because they disputed
with him. 21Then they dug another well, but they
quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah. h
22He moved on from there and dug another well, and no
one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth, i saying,
Now the LORD has given us room and we will flourish in
the land.
23From there he went up to Beersheba. 24That night
the LORD appeared to him and said, I am the God of
your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with
you; I will bless you and will increase the number of
your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.
25Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of
the LORD. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants
dug a well.
26Meanwhile, Abimelech had come to him from Gerar,
with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the
commander of his forces. 27Isaac asked them, Why
have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and
sent me away?
28They answered, We saw clearly that the LORD was
with you; so we said, There ought to be a sworn agreement
between usbetween us and you. Let us make a
treaty with you 29that you will do us no harm, just as we
did not molest you but always treated you well and sent
you away in peace. And now you are blessed by the
LORD.
30Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and
drank. 31Early the next morning the men swore an oath
to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and
they left him in peace.
32That day Isaacs servants came and told him about
the well they had dug. They said, Weve found water!
33He called it Shibah, j and to this day the name of the
town has been Beersheba. k
34When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith
daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daugh-
14 GENESIS 25:18
a 18 Or lived to the east of b 20 That is, Northwest Mesopotamia c 25 Esau may mean hairy; he was also called Edom, which means

ter of Elon the Hittite. 35They were a source of grief to
Isaac and Rebekah.
Jacob Gets Isaacs Blessing
27 When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak
that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his
older son and said to him, My son.
Here I am, he answered.
2Isaac said, I am now an old man and dont know
the day of my death. 3Now then, get your weapons
your quiver and bowand go out to the open country
to hunt some wild game for me. 4Prepare me the kind of
tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may
give you my blessing before I die.
5Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his
son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt
game and bring it back, 6Rebekah said to her son Jacob,
Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau,
7Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food
to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence
of the LORD before I die. 8Now, my son, listen carefully
and do what I tell you: 9Go out to the flock and
bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare
some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it.
10Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give
you his blessing before he dies.
11Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, But my brother
Esau is a hairy man, and Im a man with smooth skin.
12What if my father touches me? I would appear to be
tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself
rather than a blessing.
13His mother said to him, My son, let the curse fall
on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.
14So he went and got them and brought them to his
mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way
his father liked it. 15Then Rebekah took the best clothes
of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and
put them on her younger son Jacob. 16She also covered
his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the
goatskins. 17Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty
food and the bread she had made.
18He went to his father and said, My father.
Yes, my son, he answered. Who is it?
19Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your firstborn. I
have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of
my game so that you may give me your blessing.
20Isaac asked his son, How did you find it so quickly,
my son?
The LORD your God gave me success, he replied.
21Then Isaac said to Jacob, Come near so I can
touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my
son Esau or not.
22Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched
him and said, The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the
hands are the hands of Esau. 23He did not recognize
him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother
Esau; so he blessed him. 24Are you really my son Esau?
he asked.
I am, he replied.
25Then he said, My son, bring me some of your
game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.
Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought
some wine and he drank. 26Then his father Isaac said to
him, Come here, my son, and kiss me.
27So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac
caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said,
Ah, the smell of my son
is like the smell of a field
that the LORD has blessed.
28May God give you of heavens dew
and of earths richness
an abundance of grain and new wine.
29May nations serve you
and peoples bow down to you.
Be lord over your brothers,
and may the sons of your mother bow down to
you.
May those who curse you be cursed
and those who bless you be blessed.
30After Isaac finished blessing him and Jacob had
scarcely left his fathers presence, his brother Esau
came in from hunting. 31He too prepared some tasty
food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him,
My father, sit up and eat some of my game, so that you
may give me your blessing.
32His father Isaac asked him, Who are you?
I am your son, he answered, your firstborn,
Esau.
33Isaac trembled violently and said, Who was it,
then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it
just before you came and I blessed himand indeed
he will be blessed!
34When Esau heard his fathers words, he burst out
with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, Bless
meme too, my father!
35But he said, Your brother came deceitfully and
took your blessing.
36Esau said, Isnt he rightly named Jacob a? He has
deceived me these two times: He took my birthright,
and now hes taken my blessing! Then he asked,
Havent you reserved any blessing for me?
37Isaac answered Esau, I have made him lord over
you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I
have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what
can I possibly do for you, my son?
38Esau said to his father, Do you have only one
blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father! Then
Esau wept aloud.
39His father Isaac answered him,
Your dwelling will be
away from the earths richness,
away from the dew of heaven above.
40 You will live by the sword
and you will serve your brother.
But when you grow restless,
you will throw his yoke
from off your neck.
Jacob Flees to Laban
41Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the
blessing his father had given him. He said to himself,
The days of mourning for my father are near; then I
will kill my brother Jacob.
42When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau
had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to
him, Your brother Esau is consoling himself with the
thought of killing you. 43Now then, my son, do what I
say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran. 44Stay
with him for a while until your brothers fury subsides.
45When your brother is no longer angry with you and
forgets what you did to him, Ill send word for you to
come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in
one day?
46Then Rebekah said to Isaac, Im disgusted with
living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a
wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite
women like these, my life will not be worth living.
28 So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed b him and
commanded him: Do not marry a Canaanite
woman. 2Go at once to Paddan Aram, c to the house of
GENESIS 28:2 15
a 36 Jacob means he grasps the heel (figuratively, he deceives). b 1 Or greeted c 2 That is, Northwest Mesopotamia; also in verses 5,
6 and 7
your mothers father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself
there, from among the daughters of Laban, your mothers
brother. 3May God Almighty a bless you and make
you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become
a community of peoples. 4May he give you and
your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that
you may take possession of the land where you now live
as an alien, the land God gave to Abraham. 5Then Isaac
sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to
Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah,
who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
6Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and
had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there,
and that when he blessed him he commanded him,
Do not marry a Canaanite woman, 7and that Jacob
had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan
Aram. 8Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite
women were to his father Isaac; 9so he went to
Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth
and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to
the wives he already had.
Jacobs Dream at Bethel
10Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran. 11When
he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because
the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he
put it under his head and lay down to sleep. 12He had a
dream in which he saw a stairway b resting on the earth,
with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God
were ascending and descending on it. 13There above it c
stood the LORD, and he said: I am the LORD, the God of
your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give
you and your descendants the land on which you are lying.
14Your descendants will be like the dust of the
earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the
east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth
will be blessed through you and your offspring. 15I am
with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and
I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you
until I have done what I have promised you.
16When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought,
Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was not aware of
it. 17He was afraid and said, How awesome is this
place! This is none other than the house of God; this is
the gate of heaven.
18Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he
had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and
poured oil on top of it. 19He called that place Bethel, d
though the city used to be called Luz.
20Then Jacob made a vow, saying, If God will be
with me and will watch over me on this journey I am
taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear
21so that I return safely to my fathers house, then the
LORD e will be my God 22and f this stone that I have set up
as a pillar will be Gods house, and of all that you give
me I will give you a tenth.
Jacob Arrives in Paddan Aram
29 Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to
the land of the eastern peoples. 2There he saw a
well in the field, with three flocks of sheep lying near it
because the flocks were watered from that well. The
stone over the mouth of the well was large. 3When all
the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would
roll the stone away from the wells mouth and water the
sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place
over the mouth of the well.
4Jacob asked the shepherds, My brothers, where
are you from?
Were from Haran, they replied.
5He said to them, Do you know Laban, Nahors
grandson?
Yes, we know him, they answered.
6Then Jacob asked them, Is he well?
Yes, he is, they said, and here comes his daughter
Rachel with the sheep.
7Look, he said, the sun is still high; it is not time
for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take
them back to pasture.
8We cant, they replied, until all the flocks are
gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the
mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.
9While he was still talking with them, Rachel came
with her fathers sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
10When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of Laban, his mothers
brother, and Labans sheep, he went over and rolled
the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered
his uncles sheep. 11Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began
to weep aloud. 12He had told Rachel that he was a
relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran
and told her father.
13As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his
sisters son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him
and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there
Jacob told him all these things. 14Then Laban said to
him, You are my own flesh and blood.
Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel
After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month,
15Laban said to him, Just because you are a relative of
mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what
your wages should be.
16Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the
older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
17Leah had weak g eyes, but Rachel was lovely in
form, and beautiful. 18Jacob was in love with Rachel
and said, Ill work for you seven years in return for
your younger daughter Rachel.
19Laban said, Its better that I give her to you than to
some other man. Stay here with me. 20So Jacob served
seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a
few days to him because of his love for her.
21Then Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife. My
time is completed, and I want to lie with her.
22So Laban brought together all the people of the
place and gave a feast. 23But when evening came, he
took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and Jacob
lay with her. 24And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to
his daughter as her maidservant.
25When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said
to Laban, What is this you have done to me? I served
you for Rachel, didnt I? Why have you deceived me?
26Laban replied, It is not our custom here to give
the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.
27Finish this daughters bridal week; then we will give
you the younger one also, in return for another seven
years of work.
28And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah,
and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his
wife. 29Laban gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter
Rachel as her maidservant. 30Jacob lay with Rachel also,
and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he worked for
Laban another seven years.
Jacobs Children
31When the LORD saw that Leah was not loved, he
opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. 32Leah became
pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him
Reuben, h for she said, It is because the LORD has seen
my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.
16 GENESIS 28:3
a 3 Hebrew El-Shaddai b 12 Or ladder c 13 Or There beside him d19 Bethel means house of God. e 20,21 Or Since God . . .
fathers house, the LORD f 21,22 Or house, and the LORD will be my God, 22then g 17 Or delicate h 32 Reuben sounds like the Hebrew
for he has seen my misery; the name means see, a son.
33She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a
son she said, Because the LORD heard that I am not
loved, he gave me this one too. So she named him Simeon.
a
34Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a
son she said, Now at last my husband will become attached
to me, because I have borne him three sons. So
he was named Levi. b
35She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a
son she said, This time I will praise the LORD. So she
named him Judah. c Then she stopped having children.
30 When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob
any children, she became jealous of her sister. So
she said to Jacob, Give me children, or Ill die!
2Jacob became angry with her and said, AmI in the
place of God, who has kept you from having children?
3Then she said, Here is Bilhah, my maidservant.
Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and
that through her I too can build a family.
4So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob
slept with her, 5and she became pregnant and bore him
a son. 6Then Rachel said, God has vindicated me; he
has listened to my plea and given me a son. Because of
this she named him Dan. d
7Rachels servant Bilhah conceived again and bore
Jacob a second son. 8Then Rachel said, I have had a
great struggle with my sister, and I have won. So she
named him Naphtali. e
9When Leah saw that she had stopped having children,
she took her maidservant Zilpah and gave her to
Jacob as a wife. 10Leahs servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
11Then Leah said, What good fortune! f So she named
him Gad. g
12Leahs servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
13Then Leah said, How happy I am! The women will
call me happy. So she named him Asher. h
14During wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the
fields and found some mandrake plants, which he
brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah,
Please give me some of your sons mandrakes.
15But she said to her, Wasnt it enough that you took
away my husband? Will you take my sons mandrakes
too?
Very well, Rachel said, he can sleep with you tonight
in return for your sons mandrakes.
16So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening,
Leah went out to meet him. You must sleep with
me, she said. I have hired you with my sons mandrakes.
So he slept with her that night.
17God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant
and bore Jacob a fifth son. 18Then Leah said, God has
rewarded me for giving my maidservant to my husband.
So she named him Issachar. i
19Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.
20Then Leah said, God has presented me with a precious
gift. This time my husband will treat me with
honor, because I have borne him six sons. So she
named him Zebulun. j
21Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and
named her Dinah.
22Then God remembered Rachel; he listened to her
and opened her womb. 23She became pregnant and
gave birth to a son and said, God has taken away my
disgrace. 24She named him Joseph, k and said, May
the LORD add to me another son.
Jacobs Flocks Increase
25After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban,
Send me on my way so I can go back to my own
homeland. 26Give me my wives and children, for whom
I have served you, and I will be on my way. You know
how much work Ive done for you.
27But Laban said to him, If I have found favor in
your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that l
the LORD has blessed me because of you. 28He added,
Name your wages, and I will pay them.
29Jacob said to him, You know how I have worked
for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.
30The little you had before I came has increased greatly,
and the LORD has blessed you wherever I have been. But
now, when may I do something for my own household?
31What shall I give you? he asked.
Dont give me anything, Jacob replied. But if you
will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your
flocks and watching over them: 32Let me go through all
your flocks today and remove from them every speckled
or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every
spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages. 33And
my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever
you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in
my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any
lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.
34Agreed, said Laban. Let it be as you have said.
35That same day he removed all the male goats that
were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted
female goats (all that had white on them) and all the
dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of
his sons. 36Then he put a three-day journey between
himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the
rest of Labans flocks.
37Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar,
almond and plane trees and made white stripes on
them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner
wood of the branches. 38Then he placed the peeled
branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would
be directly in front of the flocks when they came to
drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,
39they mated in front of the branches. And they bore
young that were streaked or speckled or spotted. 40Jacob
set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but
made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals
that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate
flocks for himself and did not put them with Labans
animals. 41Whenever the stronger females were in heat,
Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front
of the animals so they would mate near the branches,
42but if the animals were weak, he would not place
them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the
strong ones to Jacob. 43In this way the man grew exceedingly
prosperous and came to own large flocks,
and maidservants and menservants, and camels and
donkeys.
Jacob Flees From Laban
31 Jacob heard that Labans sons were saying, Jacob
has taken everything our father owned and has
gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father.
2And Jacob noticed that Labans attitude toward
him was not what it had been.
3Then the LORD said to Jacob, Go back to the land of
your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with
you.
4So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out
to the fields where his flocks were. 5He said to them, I
see that your fathers attitude toward me is not what it
was before, but the God of my father has been with me.
GENESIS 31:5 17
a 33 Simeon probably means one who hears. b 34 Levi sounds like and may be derived from the Hebrew for attached. c 35 Judah

6You know that Ive worked for your father with all my
strength, 7yet your father has cheated me by changing
my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him
to harm me. 8If he said, The speckled ones will be your
wages, then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young;
and if he said, The streaked ones will be your wages,
then all the flocks bore streaked young. 9So God has
taken away your fathers livestock and has given them
to me.
10In breeding season I once had a dream in which I
looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the
flock were streaked, speckled or spotted. 11The angel of
God said to me in the dream, Jacob. I answered, Here I
am. 12And he said, Look up and see that all the male
goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or
spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to
you. 13I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar
and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this
land at once and go back to your native land. 
14Then Rachel and Leah replied, Do we still have
any share in the inheritance of our fathers estate?
15Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he
sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us.
16Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father
belongs to us and our children. So do whatever
God has told you.
17Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels,
18and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along
with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan
Aram, a to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.
19When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel
stole her fathers household gods. 20Moreover, Jacob deceived
Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was
running away. 21So he fled with all he had, and crossing
the River, b he headed for the hill country of Gilead.
Laban Pursues Jacob
22On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had
fled. 23Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob
for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country
of Gilead. 24Then God came to Laban the Aramean in
a dream at night and said to him, Be careful not to say
anything to Jacob, either good or bad.
25Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of
Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his
relatives camped there too. 26Then Laban said to Jacob,
What have you done? Youve deceived me, and youve
carried off my daughters like captives in war. 27Why did
you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didnt you tell
me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the
music of tambourines and harps? 28You didnt even let
me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good-by.
You have done a foolish thing. 29I have the power to
harm you; but last night the God of your father said to
me, Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good
or bad. 30Now you have gone off because you longed to
return to your fathers house. But why did you steal my
gods?
31Jacob answered Laban, I was afraid, because I
thought you would take your daughters away from me
by force. 32But if you find anyone who has your gods, he
shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for
yourself whether there is anything of yours here with
me; and if so, take it. Now Jacob did not know that Rachel
had stolen the gods.
33So Laban went into Jacobs tent and into Leahs
tent and into the tent of the two maidservants, but he
found nothing. After he came out of Leahs tent, he entered
Rachels tent. 34Now Rachel had taken the household
gods and put them inside her camels saddle and
was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything
in the tent but found nothing.
35Rachel said to her father, Dont be angry, my lord,
that I cannot stand up in your presence; Im having my
period. So he searched but could not find the household
gods.
36Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. What is
my crime? he asked Laban. What sin have I committed
that you hunt me down? 37Now that you have
searched through all my goods, what have you found
that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of
your relatives and mine, and let them judge between
the two of us.
38I have been with you for twenty years now. Your
sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten
rams from your flocks. 39I did not bring you animals
torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded
payment from me for whatever was stolen by
day or night. 40This was my situation: The heat consumed
me in the daytime and the cold at night, and
sleep fled from my eyes. 41It was like this for the twenty
years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen
years for your two daughters and six years for your
flocks, and you changed my wages ten times. 42If the
God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of
Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have
sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my
hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked
you.
43Laban answered Jacob, The women are my
daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks
are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do
today about these daughters of mine, or about the children
they have borne? 44Come now, lets make a covenant,
you and I, and let it serve as a witness between
us.
45So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. 46He
said to his relatives, Gather some stones. So they took
stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by
the heap. 47Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, c and Jacob
called it Galeed. d
48Laban said, This heap is a witness between you
and me today. That is why it was called Galeed. 49It was
also called Mizpah, e because he said, May the LORD
keep watch between you and me when we are away
from each other. 50If you mistreat my daughters or if
you take any wives besides my daughters, even though
no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between
you and me.
51Laban also said to Jacob, Here is this heap, and
here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.
52This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that
I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and
that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side
to harm me. 53May the God of Abraham and the God of
Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.
So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his
father Isaac. 54He offered a sacrifice there in the hill
country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they
had eaten, they spent the night there.
55Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren
and his daughters and blessed them. Then he
left and returned home.
Jacob Prepares to Meet Esau
32 Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God
met him. 2When Jacob saw them, he said, This is
the camp of God! So he named that place Mahanaim. f
3Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother
Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 4He instructed
them: This is what you are to say to my master
18 GENESIS 31:6
a 18 That is, Northwest Mesopotamia b 21 That is, the Euphrates c 47 The Aramaic Jegar Sahadutha means witness heap.
d 47 The Hebrew Galeed means witness heap. e 49 Mizpah means watchtower. f 2 Mahanaim means two camps.
Esau: Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with
Laban and have remained there till now. 5I have cattle
and donkeys, sheep and goats, menservants and maidservants.
Now I am sending this message to my lord,
that I may find favor in your eyes. 
6When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said,
We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to
meet you, and four hundred men are with him.
7In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people
who were with him into two groups, a and the flocks
and herds and camels as well. 8He thought, If Esau
comes and attacks one group, b the group b that is left
may escape.
9Then Jacob prayed, O God of my father Abraham,
God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, Go
back to your country and your relatives, and I will make
you prosper, 10I am unworthy of all the kindness and
faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only
my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become
two groups. 11Save me, I pray, from the hand of my
brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack
me, and also the mothers with their children. 12But you
have said, I will surely make you prosper and will make
your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot
be counted. 
13He spent the night there, and from what he had
with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau: 14two
hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred
ewes and twenty rams, 15thirty female camels with
their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female
donkeys and ten male donkeys. 16He put them in
the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to
his servants, Go ahead of me, and keep some space between
the herds.
17He instructed the one in the lead: When my
brother Esau meets you and asks, To whom do you belong,
and where are you going, and who owns all these
animals in front of you? 18then you are to say, They belong
to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my
lord Esau, and he is coming behind us. 
19He also instructed the second, the third and all the
others who followed the herds: You are to say the same
thing to Esau when you meet him. 20And be sure to say,
Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.  For he
thought, I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending
on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive
me. 21So Jacobs gifts went on ahead of him, but he
himself spent the night in the camp.
Jacob Wrestles With God
22That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his
two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the
ford of the Jabbok. 23After he had sent them across the
stream, he sent over all his possessions. 24So Jacob was
left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.
25When the man saw that he could not overpower him,
he touched the socket of Jacobs hip so that his hip was
wrenched as he wrestled with the man. 26Then the man
said, Let me go, for it is daybreak.
But Jacob replied, I will not let you go unless you
bless me.
27The man asked him, What is your name?
Jacob, he answered.
28Then the man said, Your name will no longer be
Jacob, but Israel, c because you have struggled with God
and with men and have overcome.
29Jacob said, Please tell me your name.
But he replied, Why do you ask my name? Then
he blessed him there.
30So Jacob called the place Peniel, d saying, It is because
I saw God face to face, and yet my life was
spared.
31The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, e and
he was limping because of his hip. 32Therefore to this
day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the
socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacobs hip was
touched near the tendon.
Jacob Meets Esau
33 Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with
his four hundred men; so he divided the children
among Leah, Rachel and the two maidservants. 2He put
the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and
her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.
3He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the
ground seven times as he approached his brother.
4But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he
threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And
they wept. 5Then Esau looked up and saw the women
and children. Who are these with you? he asked.
Jacob answered, They are the children God has graciously
given your servant.
6Then the maidservants and their children approached
and bowed down. 7Next, Leah and her children
came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph
and Rachel, and they too bowed down.
8Esau asked, What do you mean by all these droves
I met?
To find favor in your eyes, my lord, he said.
9But Esau said, I already have plenty, my brother.
Keep what you have for yourself.
10No, please! said Jacob. If I have found favor in
your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face
is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received
me favorably. 11Please accept the present that
was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me
and I have all I need. And because Jacob insisted, Esau
accepted it.
12Then Esau said, Let us be on our way; Ill accompany
you.
13But Jacob said to him, My lord knows that the
children are tender and that I must care for the ewes
and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven
hard just one day, all the animals will die. 14So let my
lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along
slowly at the pace of the droves before me and that of
the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.
15Esau said, Then let me leave some of my men
with you.
But why do that? Jacob asked. Just let me find favor
in the eyes of my lord.
16So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.
17Jacob, however, went to Succoth, where he built a
place for himself and made shelters for his livestock.
That is why the place is called Succoth. f
18After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, g he arrived
safely at the h city of Shechem in Canaan and camped
within sight of the city. 19For a hundred pieces of silver, i
he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem,
the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.
20There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel. j
Dinah and the Shechemites
34 Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob,
went out to visit the women of the land.
2When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of
that area, saw her, he took her and violated her. 3His
heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob, and he

loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her. 4And Shechem
said to his father Hamor, Get me this girl as my wife.
5When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had
been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock;
so he kept quiet about it until they came home.
6Then Shechems father Hamor went out to talk with
Jacob. 7Now Jacobs sons had come in from the fields as
soon as they heard what had happened. They were
filled with grief and fury, because Shechem had done a
disgraceful thing in a Israel by lying with Jacobs daughter
a thing that should not be done.
8But Hamor said to them, My son Shechem has his
heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his
wife. 9Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and
take our daughters for yourselves. 10You can settle
among us; the land is open to you. Live in it, trade b in it,
and acquire property in it.
11Then Shechem said to Dinahs father and brothers,
Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you
whatever you ask. 12Make the price for the bride and
the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and Ill pay
whatever you ask me. Only give me the girl as my wife.
13Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacobs
sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem
and his father Hamor. 14They said to them, We cant do
such a thing; we cant give our sister to a man who is not
circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us. 15We will
give our consent to you on one condition only: that you
become like us by circumcising all your males. 16Then
we will give you our daughters and take your daughters
for ourselves. Well settle among you and become one
people with you. 17But if you will not agree to be circumcised,
well take our sister c and go.
18Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son
Shechem. 19The young man, who was the most honored
of all his fathers household, lost no time in doing
what they said, because he was delighted with Jacobs
daughter. 20So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the
gate of their city to speak to their fellow townsmen.
21These men are friendly toward us, they said. Let
them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty
of room for them. We can marry their daughters and
they can marry ours. 22But the men will consent to live
with us as one people only on the condition that our
males be circumcised, as they themselves are. 23Wont
their livestock, their property and all their other animals
become ours? So let us give our consent to them,
and they will settle among us.
24All the men who went out of the city gate agreed
with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in
the city was circumcised.
25Three days later, while all of them were still in
pain, two of Jacobs sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinahs
brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting
city, killing every male. 26They put Hamor and
his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from
Shechems house and left. 27The sons of Jacob came
upon the dead bodies and looted the city where d their
sister had been defiled. 28They seized their flocks and
herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the
city and out in the fields. 29They carried off all their
wealth and all their women and children, taking as
plunder everything in the houses.
30Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have
brought trouble on me by making me a stench to the
Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this
land. We are few in number, and if they join forces
against me and attack me, I and my household will be
destroyed.
31But they replied, Should he have treated our sister
like a prostitute?
Jacob Returns to Bethel
35 Then God said to Jacob, Go up to Bethel and settle
there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared
to you when you were fleeing from your brother
Esau.
2So Jacob said to his household and to all who were
with him, Get rid of the foreign gods you have with
you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes.
3Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an
altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress
and who has been with me wherever I have gone.
4So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the
rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the
oak at Shechem. 5Then they set out, and the terror of
God fell upon the towns all around them so that no one
pursued them.
6Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that
is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. 7There he built an altar,
and he called the place El Bethel, e because it was
there that God revealed himself to him when he was
fleeing from his brother.
8Now Deborah, Rebekahs nurse, died and was buried
under the oak below Bethel. So it was named Allon
Bacuth. f
9After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram, g God appeared
to him again and blessed him. 10God said to
him, Your name is Jacob, h but you will no longer be
called Jacob; your name will be Israel. i So he named
him Israel.
11And God said to him, I am God Almighty j; be
fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community
of nations will come from you, and kings will come
from your body. 12The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac
I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants
after you. 13Then God went up from him at
the place where he had talked with him.
14Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God
had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering
on it; he also poured oil on it. 15Jacob called the place
where God had talked with him Bethel. k
The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac
16Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were
still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give
birth and had great difficulty. 17And as she was having
great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her,
Dont be afraid, for you have another son. 18As she
breathed her lastfor she was dyingshe named her
son Ben-Oni. l But his father named him Benjamin. m
19So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath
(that is, Bethlehem). 20Over her tomb Jacob set up
a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachels tomb.
21Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond
Migdal Eder. 22While Israel was living in that region,
Reuben went in and slept with his fathers concubine
Bilhah, and Israel heard of it.
Jacob had twelve sons:
23 The sons of Leah:
Reuben the firstborn of Jacob,
Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun.
24 The sons of Rachel:
Joseph and Benjamin.
25 The sons of Rachels maidservant Bilhah:
Dan and Naphtali.
26 The sons of Leahs maidservant Zilpah:
Gad and Asher.

These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him
in Paddan Aram.
27Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre,
near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and
Isaac had stayed. 28Isaac lived a hundred and eighty
years. 29Then he breathed his last and died and was
gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his
sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
Esaus Descendants
36 This is the account of Esau (that is, Edom).
2Esau took his wives from the women of Canaan:
Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah
daughter of Anah and granddaughter of
Zibeon the Hivite 3also Basemath daughter of
Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
4Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore
Reuel, 5and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam and
Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were
born to him in Canaan.
6Esau took his wives and sons and daughters
and all the members of his household, as well as
his livestock and all his other animals and all the
goods he had acquired in Canaan, and moved to a
land some distance from his brother Jacob. 7Their
possessions were too great for them to remain together;
the land where they were staying could not
support them both because of their livestock. 8So
Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the hill country of
Seir.
9This is the account of Esau the father of the Edomites
in the hill country of Seir.
10 These are the names of Esaus sons:
Eliphaz, the son of Esaus wife Adah, and Reuel,
the son of Esaus wife Basemath.
11 The sons of Eliphaz:
Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam and Kenaz.
12 Esaus son Eliphaz also had a concubine named
Timna, who bore him Amalek. These were
grandsons of Esaus wife Adah.
13 The sons of Reuel:
Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These
were grandsons of Esaus wife Basemath.
14 The sons of Esaus wife Oholibamah daughter of
Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon, whom she
bore to Esau:
Jeush, Jalam and Korah.
15These were the chiefs among Esaus descendants:
The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau:
Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 16Korah, a
Gatam and Amalek. These were the chiefs descended
from Eliphaz in Edom; they were
grandsons of Adah.
17 The sons of Esaus son Reuel:
Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah.
These were the chiefs descended from Reuel in
Edom; they were grandsons of Esaus wife Basemath.
18 The sons of Esaus wife Oholibamah:
Chiefs Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the
chiefs descended from Esaus wife Oholibamah
daughter of Anah.
19These were the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and
these were their chiefs.
20These were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were
living in the region:
Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 21Dishon, Ezer
and Dishan. These sons of Seir in Edom were
Horite chiefs.
22 The sons of Lotan:
Hori and Homam. b Timna was Lotans sister.
23 The sons of Shobal:
Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
24 The sons of Zibeon:
Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who discovered
the hot springs c in the desert while he was grazing
the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
25 The children of Anah:
Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
26 The sons of Dishon d:
Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran and Keran.
27 The sons of Ezer:
Bilhan, Zaavan and Akan.
28 The sons of Dishan:
Uz and Aran.
29 These were the Horite chiefs:
Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 30Dishon, Ezer
and Dishan. These were the Horite chiefs, according
to their divisions, in the land of Seir.
The Rulers of Edom
31These were the kings who reigned in Edom before
any Israelite king reigned e:
32Bela son of Beor became king of Edom. His city
was named Dinhabah.
33 When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah
succeeded him as king.
34 When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the
Temanites succeeded him as king.
35 When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated
Midian in the country of Moab, succeeded
him as king. His city was named Avith.
36When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah succeeded
him as king.
37 When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the
river f succeeded him as king.
38 When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan son of Acbor succeeded
him as king.
39 When Baal-Hanan son of Acbor died, Hadad g succeeded
him as king. His city was named Pau,
and his wifes name was Mehetabel daughter of
Matred, the daughter of Me-Zahab.
40These were the chiefs descended from Esau, by
name, according to their clans and regions:
Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 41Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,
42Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 43Magdiel and
Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according
to their settlements in the land they occupied.
This was Esau the father of the Edomites.
Josephs Dreams
37 Jacob lived in the land where his father had
stayed, the land of Canaan.
2This is the account of Jacob.
Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the
flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons
of Zilpah, his fathers wives, and he brought their father
a bad report about them.
3Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other
sons, because he had been born to him in his old age;

and he made a richly ornamented a robe for him.
4When his brothers saw that their father loved him
more than any of them, they hated him and could not
speak a kind word to him.
5Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his
brothers, they hated him all the more. 6He said to them,
Listen to this dream I had: 7We were binding sheaves of
grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and
stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around
mine and bowed down to it.
8His brothers said to him, Do you intend to reign
over us? Will you actually rule us? And they hated him
all the more because of his dream and what he had
said.
9Then he had another dream, and he told it to his
brothers. Listen, he said, I had another dream, and
this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing
down to me.
10When he told his father as well as his brothers, his
father rebuked him and said, What is this dream you
had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually
come and bow down to the ground before you? 11His
brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the
matter in mind.
Joseph Sold by His Brothers
12Now his brothers had gone to graze their fathers
flocks near Shechem, 13and Israel said to Joseph, As
you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near
Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.
Very well, he replied.
14So he said to him, Go and see if all is well with
your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back
to me. Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron.
When Joseph arrived at Shechem, 15a man found
him wandering around in the fields and asked him,
What are you looking for?
16He replied, Im looking for my brothers. Can you
tell me where they are grazing their flocks?
17They have moved on from here, the man answered.
I heard them say, Lets go to Dothan. 
So Joseph went after his brothers and found them
near Dothan. 18But they saw him in the distance, and
before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
19Here comes that dreamer! they said to each other.
20Come now, lets kill him and throw him into one of
these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured
him. Then well see what comes of his dreams.
21When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him
from their hands. Lets not take his life, he said.
22Dont shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern
here in the desert, but dont lay a hand on him. Reuben
said this to rescue him from them and take him back to
his father.
23So when Joseph came to his brothers, they
stripped him of his robethe richly ornamented robe
he was wearing 24and they took him and threw him
into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was
no water in it.
25As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up
and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead.
Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh,
and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.
26Judah said to his brothers, What will we gain if we
kill our brother and cover up his blood? 27Come, lets
sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on
him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and
blood. His brothers agreed.
28So when the Midianite merchants came by, his
brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold
him for twenty shekels b of silver to the Ishmaelites,
who took him to Egypt.
29When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that
Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes. 30He went
back to his brothers and said, The boy isnt there!
Where can I turn now?
31Then they got Josephs robe, slaughtered a goat
and dipped the robe in the blood. 32They took the ornamented
robe back to their father and said, We found
this. Examine it to see whether it is your sons robe.
33He recognized it and said, It is my sons robe!
Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has
surely been torn to pieces.
34Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and
mourned for his son many days. 35All his sons and
daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be
comforted. No, he said, in mourning will I go down to
the grave c to my son. So his father wept for him.
36Meanwhile, the Midianites d sold Joseph in Egypt
to Potiphar, one of Pharaohs officials, the captain of the
guard.
Judah and Tamar
38 At that time, Judah left his brothers and went
down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah.
2There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man
named Shua. He married her and lay with her; 3she became
pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named
Er. 4She conceived again and gave birth to a son and
named him Onan. 5She gave birth to still another son
and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave
birth to him.
6Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name
was Tamar. 7But Er, Judahs firstborn, was wicked in the
LORDs sight; so the LORD put him to death.
8Then Judah said to Onan, Lie with your brothers
wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to
produce offspring for your brother. 9But Onan knew
that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he lay
with his brothers wife, he spilled his semen on the
ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother.
10What he did was wicked in the LORDs sight; so he
put him to death also.
11Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar,
Live as a widow in your fathers house until my son
Shelah grows up. For he thought, He may die too, just
like his brothers. So Tamar went to live in her fathers
house.
12After a long time Judahs wife, the daughter of
Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he
went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his
sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with
him.
13When Tamar was told, Your father-in-law is on his
way to Timnah to shear his sheep, 14she took off her
widows clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise
herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim,
which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that,
though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been
given to him as his wife.
15When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute,
for she had covered her face. 16Not realizing that
she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the
roadside and said, Come now, let me sleep with you.
And what will you give me to sleep with you? she
asked.
17Ill send you a young goat from my flock, he said.
Will you give me something as a pledge until you
send it? she asked.
18He said, What pledge should I give you?
22 GENESIS 37:4
a 3 The meaning of the Hebrew for richly ornamented is uncertain; also in verses 23 and 32. b 28 That is, about 8 ounces (about
0.2 kilogram) c 35 Hebrew Sheol d 36 Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac (see also verse 28); Masoretic Text
Medanites
Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand,
she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with
her, and she became pregnant by him. 19After she left,
she took off her veil and put on her widows clothes
again.
20Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend
the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the
woman, but he did not find her. 21He asked the men
who lived there, Where is the shrine prostitute who
was beside the road at Enaim?
There hasnt been any shrine prostitute here, they
said.
22So he went back to Judah and said, I didnt find
her. Besides, the men who lived there said, There hasnt
been any shrine prostitute here. 
23Then Judah said, Let her keep what she has, or we
will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her
this young goat, but you didnt find her.
24About three months later Judah was told, Your
daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a
result she is now pregnant.
Judah said, Bring her out and have her burned to
death!
25As she was being brought out, she sent a message
to her father-in-law. I am pregnant by the man who
owns these, she said. And she added, See if you recognize
whose seal and cord and staff these are.
26Judah recognized them and said, She is more
righteous than I, since I wouldnt give her to my son
Shelah. And he did not sleep with her again.
27When the time came for her to give birth, there
were twin boys in her womb. 28As she was giving birth,
one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a
scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, This
one came out first. 29But when he drew back his hand,
his brother came out, and she said, So this is how you
have broken out! And he was named Perez. a 30Then
his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist,
came out and he was given the name Zerah. b
Joseph and Potiphars Wife
39 Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar,
an Egyptian who was one of Pharaohs officials,
the captain of the guard, bought him from the
Ishmaelites who had taken him there.
2The LORD was with Joseph and he prospered, and he
lived in the house of his Egyptian master. 3When his
master saw that the LORD was with him and that the
LORD gave him success in everything he did, 4Joseph
found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar
put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted
to his care everything he owned. 5From the time
he put him in charge of his household and of all that he
owned, the LORD blessed the household of the Egyptian
because of Joseph. The blessing of the LORD was on everything
Potiphar had, both in the house and in the
field. 6So he left in Josephs care everything he had; with
Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything
except the food he ate.
Now Joseph was well-built and handsome, 7and after
a while his masters wife took notice of Joseph and said,
Come to bed with me!
8But he refused. With me in charge, he told her,
my master does not concern himself with anything in
the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my
care. 9No one is greater in this house than I am. My
master has withheld nothing from me except you, because
you are his wife. How then could I do such a
wicked thing and sin against God? 10And though she
spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed
with her or even be with her.
11One day he went into the house to attend to his
duties, and none of the household servants was inside.
12She caught him by his cloak and said, Come to bed
with me! But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of
the house.
13When she saw that he had left his cloak in her
hand and had run out of the house, 14she called her
household servants. Look, she said to them, this Hebrew
has been brought to us to make sport of us! He
came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed. 15When
he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside
me and ran out of the house.
16She kept his cloak beside her until his master
came home. 17Then she told him this story: That Hebrew
slave you brought us came to me to make sport of
me. 18But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his
cloak beside me and ran out of the house.
19When his master heard the story his wife told him,
saying, This is how your slave treated me, he burned
with anger. 20Josephs master took him and put him in
prison, the place where the kings prisoners were confined.
But while Joseph was there in the prison, 21the
LORD was with him; he showed him kindness and
granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.
22So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held
in the prison, and he was made responsible for all
that was done there. 23The warden paid no attention
to anything under Josephs care, because the LORD
was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he
did.
The Cupbearer and the Baker
40 Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of
the king of Egypt offended their master, the king
of Egypt. 2Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the
chief cupbearer and the chief baker, 3and put them in
custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the
same prison where Joseph was confined. 4The captain
of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended
them.
After they had been in custody for some time, 5each
of the two menthe cupbearer and the baker of the
king of Egypt, who were being held in prisonhad a
dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning
of its own.
6When Joseph came to them the next morning, he
saw that they were dejected. 7So he asked Pharaohs officials
who were in custody with him in his masters
house, Why are your faces so sad today?
8We both had dreams, they answered, but there is
no one to interpret them.
Then Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations
belong to God? Tell me your dreams.
9So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He
said to him, In my dream I saw a vine in front of me,
10and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it
budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into
grapes. 11Pharaohs cup was in my hand, and I took the
grapes, squeezed them into Pharaohs cup and put the
cup in his hand.
12This is what it means, Joseph said to him. The
three branches are three days. 13Within three days
Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your
position, and you will put Pharaohs cup in his hand,
just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
14But when all goes well with you, remember me and
show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me
out of this prison. 15For I was forcibly carried off from
the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done
nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.
16When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a
favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, I too had a

dream: On my head were three baskets of bread. a 17In
the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh,
but the birds were eating them out of the basket on
my head.
18This is what it means, Joseph said. The three
baskets are three days. 19Within three days Pharaoh will
lift off your head and hang you on a tree. b And the birds
will eat away your flesh.
20Now the third day was Pharaohs birthday, and he
gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of
the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence
of his officials: 21He restored the chief cupbearer to his
position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaohs
hand, 22but he hanged c the chief baker, just as Joseph
had said to them in his interpretation.
23The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember
Joseph; he forgot him.
Pharaohs Dreams
41 When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a
dream: He was standing by the Nile, 2when out of
the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and
they grazed among the reeds. 3After them, seven other
cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and
stood beside those on the riverbank. 4And the cows that
were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows.
Then Pharaoh woke up.
5He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven
heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a
single stalk. 6After them, seven other heads of grain
sproutedthin and scorched by the east wind. 7The
thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full
heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream.
8In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent
for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh
told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them
for him.
9Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, Today I
am reminded of my shortcomings. 10Pharaoh was once
angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the
chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.
11Each of us had a dream the same night, and each
dream had a meaning of its own. 12Now a young Hebrew
was there with us, a servant of the captain of the
guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted
them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his
dream. 13And things turned out exactly as he interpreted
them to us: I was restored to my position, and the
other man was hanged. c
14So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly
brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and
changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.
15Pharaoh said to Joseph, I had a dream, and no
one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that
when you hear a dream you can interpret it.
16I cannot do it, Joseph replied to Pharaoh, but
God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.
17Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream I was
standing on the bank of the Nile, 18when out of the river
there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they
grazed among the reeds. 19After them, seven other cows
came upscrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never
seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt. 20The lean,
ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first.
21But even after they ate them, no one could tell that
they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before.
Then I woke up.
22In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full
and good, growing on a single stalk. 23After them, seven
other heads sproutedwithered and thin and scorched
by the east wind. 24The thin heads of grain swallowed up
the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but
none could explain it to me.
25Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dreams of
Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to
Pharaoh what he is about to do. 26The seven good cows
are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are
seven years; it is one and the same dream. 27The seven
lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years,
and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched
by the east wind: They are seven years of famine.
28It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown
Pharaoh what he is about to do. 29Seven years of great
abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,
30but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all
the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine
will ravage the land. 31The abundance in the land
will not be remembered, because the famine that follows
it will be so severe. 32The reason the dream was
given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has
been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon.
33And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and
wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.
34Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to
take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven
years of abundance. 35They should collect all the food of
these good years that are coming and store up the grain
under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities
for food. 36This food should be held in reserve for the
country, to be used during the seven years of famine
that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not
be ruined by the famine.
37The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his
officials. 38So Pharaoh asked them, Can we find anyone
like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God d?
39Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, Since God has made
all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and
wise as you. 40You shall be in charge of my palace, and all
my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect
to the throne will I be greater than you.
Joseph in Charge of Egypt
41So Pharaoh said to Joseph, I hereby put you in
charge of the whole land of Egypt. 42Then Pharaoh
took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Josephs
finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and
put a gold chain around his neck. 43He had him ride in
a chariot as his second-in-command, e and men shouted
before him, Make way f! Thus he put him in charge
of the whole land of Egypt.
44Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, but
without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all
Egypt. 45Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-
Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera,
priest of On, g to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout
the land of Egypt.
46Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the
service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out
from Pharaohs presence and traveled throughout
Egypt. 47During the seven years of abundance the land
produced plentifully. 48Joseph collected all the food
produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt
and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food
grown in the fields surrounding it. 49Joseph stored up
huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was
so much that he stopped keeping records because it
was beyond measure.
50Before the years of famine came, two sons were
born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest
of On. 51Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh h and
24 GENESIS 40:17
a 16 Or three wicker baskets b 19 Or and impale you on a pole c 22,13 Or impaled d 38 Or of the gods e 43 Or in the chariot of his
second-in-command; or in his second chariot f 43 Or Bow down g 45 That is, Heliopolis; also in verse 50 h 51 Manasseh sounds
like and may be derived from the Hebrew for forget.
said, It is because God has made me forget all my trouble
and all my fathers household. 52The second son he
named Ephraim a and said, It is because God has made
me fruitful in the land of my suffering.
53The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an
end, 54and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph
had said. There was famine in all the other lands,
but in the whole land of Egypt there was food. 55When
all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to
Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians,
Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.
56When the famine had spread over the whole country,
Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to
the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout
Egypt. 57And all the countries came to Egypt to buy
grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all
the world.
Josephs Brothers Go to Egypt
42 When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt,
he said to his sons, Why do you just keep looking
at each other? 2He continued, I have heard that there
is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so
that we may live and not die.
3Then ten of Josephs brothers went down to buy
grain from Egypt. 4But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Josephs
brother, with the others, because he was afraid
that harm might come to him. 5So Israels sons were
among those who went to buy grain, for the famine was
in the land of Canaan also.
6Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the one
who sold grain to all its people. So when Josephs brothers
arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to
the ground. 7As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized
them, but he pretended to be a stranger and
spoke harshly to them. Where do you come from? he
asked.
From the land of Canaan, they replied, to buy
food.
8Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did
not recognize him. 9Then he remembered his dreams
about them and said to them, You are spies! You have
come to see where our land is unprotected.
10No, my lord, they answered. Your servants have
come to buy food. 11We are all the sons of one man.
Your servants are honest men, not spies.
12No! he said to them. You have come to see
where our land is unprotected.
13But they replied, Your servants were twelve brothers,
the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan.
The youngest is now with our father, and one is no
more.
14Joseph said to them, It is just as I told you: You are
spies! 15And this is how you will be tested: As surely as
Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your
youngest brother comes here. 16Send one of your number
to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in
prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you
are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as
Pharaoh lives, you are spies! 17And he put them all in
custody for three days.
18On the third day, Joseph said to them, Do this and
you will live, for I fear God: 19If you are honest men, let
one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of
you go and take grain back for your starving households.
20But you must bring your youngest brother to
me, so that your words may be verified and that you
may not die. This they proceeded to do.
21They said to one another, Surely we are being
punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed
he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but
we would not listen; thats why this distress has come
upon us.
22Reuben replied, Didnt I tell you not to sin against
the boy? But you wouldnt listen! Now we must give an
accounting for his blood. 23They did not realize that
Joseph could understand them, since he was using an
interpreter.
24He turned away from them and began to weep,
but then turned back and spoke to them again. He had
Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes.
25Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to
put each mans silver back in his sack, and to give them
provisions for their journey. After this was done for
them, 26they loaded their grain on their donkeys and
left.
27At the place where they stopped for the night one
of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and
he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack. 28My silver
has been returned, he said to his brothers. Here it is in
my sack.
Their hearts sank and they turned to each other
trembling and said, What is this that God has done
to us?
29When they came to their father Jacob in the land of
Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them.
They said, 30The man who is lord over the land spoke
harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying
on the land. 31But we said to him, We are honest men;
we are not spies. 32We were twelve brothers, sons of one
father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with
our father in Canaan.
33Then the man who is lord over the land said to
us, This is how I will know whether you are honest
men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take
food for your starving households and go. 34But bring
your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are
not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother
back to you, and you can trade b in the land. 
35As they were emptying their sacks, there in each
mans sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their
father saw the money pouches, they were frightened.
36Their father Jacob said to them, You have deprived
me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no
more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything
is against me!
37Then Reuben said to his father, You may put both
of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you.
Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back.
38But Jacob said, My son will not go down there
with you; his brother is dead and he is the only one left.
If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking,
you will bring my gray head down to the grave c in sorrow.
The Second Journey to Egypt
43 Now the famine was still severe in the land. 2So
when they had eaten all the grain they had
brought from Egypt, their father said to them, Go back
and buy us a little more food.
3But Judah said to him, The man warned us solemnly,
You will not see my face again unless your
brother is with you. 4If you will send our brother along
with us, we will go down and buy food for you. 5But if
you will not send him, we will not go down, because the
man said to us, You will not see my face again unless
your brother is with you. 
6Israel asked, Why did you bring this trouble on me
by telling the man you had another brother?
7They replied, The man questioned us closely
about ourselves and our family. Is your father still living?
he asked us. Do you have another brother? We
GENESIS 43:7 25
a 52 Ephraim sounds like the Hebrew for twice fruitful. b 34 Or move about freely c 38 Hebrew Sheol
simply answered his questions. How were we to know
he would say, Bring your brother down here?
8Then Judah said to Israel his father, Send the boy
along with me and we will go at once, so that we and
you and our children may live and not die. 9I myself will
guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible
for him. If I do not bring him back to you and
set him here before you, I will bear the blame before
you all my life. 10As it is, if we had not delayed, we could
have gone and returned twice.
11Then their father Israel said to them, If it must be,
then do this: Put some of the best products of the land
in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift
a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh,
some pistachio nuts and almonds. 12Take double the
amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver
that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps
it was a mistake. 13Take your brother also and go
back to the man at once. 14And may God Almighty a
grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your
other brother and Benjamin come back with you. As for
me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.
15So the men took the gifts and double the amount of
silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt
and presented themselves to Joseph. 16When Joseph
saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his
house, Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal
and prepare dinner; they are to eat with me at
noon.
17The man did as Joseph told him and took the men
to Josephs house. 18Now the men were frightened when
they were taken to his house. They thought, We were
brought here because of the silver that was put back
into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and
overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys.
19So they went up to Josephs steward and spoke to
him at the entrance to the house. 20Please, sir, they
said, we came down here the first time to buy food.
21But at the place where we stopped for the night we
opened our sacks and each of us found his silverthe
exact weightin the mouth of his sack. So we have
brought it back with us. 22We have also brought additional
silver with us to buy food. We dont know who put
our silver in our sacks.
23Its all right, he said. Dont be afraid. Your God,
the God of your father, has given you treasure in your
sacks; I received your silver. Then he brought Simeon
out to them.
24The steward took the men into Josephs house,
gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder
for their donkeys. 25They prepared their gifts for Josephs
arrival at noon, because they had heard that they
were to eat there.
26When Joseph came home, they presented to him
the gifts they had brought into the house, and they
bowed down before him to the ground. 27He asked
them how they were, and then he said, How is your
aged father you told me about? Is he still living?
28They replied, Your servant our father is still alive
and well. And they bowed low to pay him honor.
29As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin,
his own mothers son, he asked, Is this your youngest
brother, the one you told me about? And he said, God
be gracious to you, my son. 30Deeply moved at the
sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a
place to weep. He went into his private room and wept
there.
31After he had washed his face, he came out and,
controlling himself, said, Serve the food.
32They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves,
and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves,
because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews,
for that is detestable to Egyptians. 33The men had been
seated before him in the order of their ages, from the
firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other
in astonishment. 34When portions were served to
them from Josephs table, Benjamins portion was five
times as much as anyone elses. So they feasted and
drank freely with him.
A Silver Cup in a Sack
44 Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward
of his house: Fill the mens sacks with as
much food as they can carry, and put each mans silver
in the mouth of his sack. 2Then put my cup, the silver
one, in the mouth of the youngest ones sack, along
with the silver for his grain. And he did as Joseph said.
3As morning dawned, the men were sent on their
way with their donkeys. 4They had not gone far from
the city when Joseph said to his steward, Go after those
men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to
them, Why have you repaid good with evil? 5Isnt this
the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination?
This is a wicked thing you have done. 
6When he caught up with them, he repeated these
words to them. 7But they said to him, Why does my
lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do
anything like that! 8We even brought back to you from
the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the
mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or
gold from your masters house? 9If any of your servants
is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will become
my lords slaves.
10Very well, then, he said, let it be as you say.
Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the
rest of you will be free from blame.
11Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the
ground and opened it. 12Then the steward proceeded
to search, beginning with the oldest and ending with
the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamins
sack. 13At this, they tore their clothes. Then they all
loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.
14Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his
brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the
ground before him. 15Joseph said to them, What is this
you have done? Dont you know that a man like me can
find things out by divination?
16What can we say to my lord? Judah replied.
What can we say? How can we prove our innocence?
God has uncovered your servants guilt. We are now my
lords slaveswe ourselves and the one who was found
to have the cup.
17But Joseph said, Far be it from me to do such a
thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will
become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father
in peace.
18Then Judah went up to him and said: Please, my
lord, let your servant speak a word to my lord. Do not be
angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh
himself. 19My lord asked his servants, Do you have
a father or a brother? 20And we answered, We have an
aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his
old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his
mothers sons left, and his father loves him.
21Then you said to your servants, Bring him down
to me so I can see him for myself. 22And we said to my
lord, The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him,
his father will die. 23But you told your servants, Unless
your youngest brother comes down with you, you will
not see my face again. 24When we went back to your
servant my father, we told him what my lord had said.
25Then our father said, Go back and buy a little
26 GENESIS 43:8
a 14 Hebrew El-Shaddai
more food. 26But we said, We cannot go down. Only if
our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot
see the mans face unless our youngest brother is
with us.
27Your servant my father said to us, You know that
my wife bore me two sons. 28One of them went away
from me, and I said, He has surely been torn to pieces.
And I have not seen him since. 29If you take this one
from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my
gray head down to the grave a in misery.
30So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to
your servant my father and if my father, whose life is
closely bound up with the boys life, 31sees that the boy
isnt there, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray
head of our father down to the grave in sorrow. 32Your
servant guaranteed the boys safety to my father. I said,
If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame
before you, my father, all my life!
33Now then, please let your servant remain here as
my lords slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return
with his brothers. 34How can I go back to my father if the
boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery
that would come upon my father.
Joseph Makes Himself Known
45 Then Joseph could no longer control himself before
all his attendants, and he cried out, Have everyone
leave my presence! So there was no one with Joseph
when he made himself known to his brothers.
2And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him,
and Pharaohs household heard about it.
3Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph! Is my father
still living? But his brothers were not able to answer
him, because they were terrified at his presence.
4Then Joseph said to his brothers, Come close to
me. When they had done so, he said, I am your brother
Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! 5And now, do
not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves
for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God
sent me ahead of you. 6For two years now there has
been famine in the land, and for the next five years
there will not be plowing and reaping. 7But God sent
me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth
and to save your lives by a great deliverance. b
8So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God.
He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household
and ruler of all Egypt. 9Now hurry back to my father
and say to him, This is what your son Joseph says:
God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me;
dont delay. 10You shall live in the region of Goshen and
be near meyou, your children and grandchildren,
your flocks and herds, and all you have. 11I will provide
for you there, because five years of famine are still to
come. Otherwise you and your household and all who
belong to you will become destitute.
12You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother
Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you.
13Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in
Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring
my father down here quickly.
14Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin
and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping.
15And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward
his brothers talked with him.
16When the news reached Pharaohs palace that Josephs
brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials
were pleased. 17Pharaoh said to Joseph, Tell your
brothers, Do this: Load your animals and return to the
land of Canaan, 18and bring your father and your families
back to me. I will give you the best of the land of
Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.
19You are also directed to tell them, Do this: Take
some carts from Egypt for your children and your
wives, and get your father and come. 20Never mind
about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt
will be yours. 
21So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them
carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave
them provisions for their journey. 22To each of them he
gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred
shekels c of silver and five sets of clothes. 23And this
is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the
best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded
with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey.
24Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were
leaving he said to them, Dont quarrel on the way!
25So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father
Jacob in the land of Canaan. 26They told him, Joseph
is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt. Jacob
was stunned; he did not believe them. 27But when they
told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when
he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the
spirit of their father Jacob revived. 28And Israel said,
Im convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and
see him before I die.
Jacob Goes to Egypt
46 So Israel set out with all that was his, and when he
reached Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the
God of his father Isaac.
2And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and
said, Jacob! Jacob!
Here I am, he replied.
3I am God, the God of your father, he said. Do not
be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a
great nation there. 4I will go down to Egypt with you,
and I will surely bring you back again. And Josephs own
hand will close your eyes.
5Then Jacob left Beersheba, and Israels sons took
their father Jacob and their children and their wives in
the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him. 6They
also took with them their livestock and the possessions
they had acquired in Canaan, and Jacob and all his offspring
went to Egypt. 7He took with him to Egypt his
sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters
all his offspring.
8These are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob
and his descendants) who went to Egypt:
Reuben the firstborn of Jacob.
9 The sons of Reuben:
Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.
10 The sons of Simeon:
Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul
the son of a Canaanite woman.
11 The sons of Levi:

25These were the sons born to Jacob by Bilhah,

26All those who went to Egypt with Jacobthose
who were his direct descendants, not counting his sons
wivesnumbered sixty-six persons. 27With the two
sons c who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members
of Jacobs family, which went to Egypt, were seventy
d in all.
28Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to
get directions to Goshen. When they arrived in the region
of Goshen, 29Joseph had his chariot made ready
and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as
Joseph appeared before him, he threw his arms around
his father e and wept for a long time.
30Israel said to Joseph, Now I am ready to die, since
I have seen for myself that you are still alive.
31Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his fathers
household, I will go up and speak to Pharaoh and will
say to him, My brothers and my fathers household,
who were living in the land of Canaan, have come to
me. 32The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and
they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything
they own. 33When Pharaoh calls you in and
asks, What is your occupation? 34you should answer,
Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood
on, just as our fathers did. Then you will be allowed to
settle in the region of Goshen, for all shepherds are detestable
to the Egyptians.
47 Joseph went and told Pharaoh, My father and
brothers, with their flocks and herds and everything
they own, have come from the land of Canaan
and are now in Goshen. 2He chose five of his brothers
and presented them before Pharaoh.
3Pharaoh asked the brothers, What is your occupation?
Your servants are shepherds, they replied to Pharaoh,
just as our fathers were. 4They also said to him,
We have come to live here awhile, because the famine
is severe in Canaan and your servants flocks have no
pasture. So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen.
5Pharaoh said to Joseph, Your father and your
brothers have come to you, 6and the land of Egypt is
before you; settle your father and your brothers in the
best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if
you know of any among them with special ability, put
them in charge of my own livestock.
7Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented
him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed f Pharaoh,
8Pharaoh asked him, How old are you?
9And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The years of my pilgrimage
are a hundred and thirty. My years have been
few and difficult, and they do not equal the years of the
pilgrimage of my fathers. 10Then Jacob blessed g Pharaoh
and went out from his presence.
11So Joseph settled his father and his brothers in
Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the
land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh directed. 12Joseph
also provided his father and his brothers and all his
fathers household with food, according to the number
of their children.
Joseph and the Famine
13There was no food, however, in the whole region
because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan
wasted away because of the famine. 14Joseph collected
all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan
in payment for the grain they were buying, and
he brought it to Pharaohs palace. 15When the money of
the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt
came to Joseph and said, Give us food. Why should we
die before your eyes? Our money is used up.
16Then bring your livestock, said Joseph. I will sell
you food in exchange for your livestock, since your
money is gone. 17So they brought their livestock to Joseph,
and he gave them food in exchange for their
horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle and donkeys.
And he brought them through that year with food in exchange
for all their livestock.
18When that year was over, they came to him the following
year and said, We cannot hide from our lord the
fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs
to you, there is nothing left for our lord except our
bodies and our land. 19Why should we perish before your
eyeswe and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange
for food, and we with our land will be in bondage
to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die,
and that the land may not become desolate.
20So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh.
The Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields, because
the famine was too severe for them. The land became
Pharaohs, 21and Joseph reduced the people to
servitude, h from one end of Egypt to the other. 22However,
he did not buy the land of the priests, because
they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and
had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave
them. That is why they did not sell their land.
23Joseph said to the people, Now that I have bought
you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for
you so you can plant the ground. 24But when the crop
comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other fourfifths
you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for
yourselves and your households and your children.
25You have saved our lives, they said. May we find
favor in the eyes of our lord; we will be in bondage to
Pharaoh.
26So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in
Egyptstill in force todaythat a fifth of the produce
belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests
that did not become Pharaohs.
27Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of
28 GENESIS 46:16
a 16 Samaritan Pentateuch and Septuagint (see also Num. 26:15); Masoretic Text Ziphion b 20 That is, Heliopolis c 27 Hebrew;

around him f 7 Or greeted g 10 Or said farewell to h 21 Samaritan Pentateuch and Septuagint (see also Vulgate); Masoretic Text
and he moved the people into the cities
Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful
and increased greatly in number.
28Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and the years
of his life were a hundred and forty-seven. 29When the
time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph
and said to him, If I have found favor in your eyes,
put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will
show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in
Egypt, 30but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of
Egypt and bury me where they are buried.
I will do as you say, he said.
31Swear to me, he said. Then Joseph swore to him,
and Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his
staff. a
Manasseh and Ephraim
48 Some time later Joseph was told, Your father is
ill. So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim
along with him. 2When Jacob was told, Your son Joseph
has come to you, Israel rallied his strength and sat
up on the bed.
3Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty b appeared to
me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed
me 4and said to me, I am going to make you fruitful
and will increase your numbers. I will make you a community
of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting
possession to your descendants after you.
5Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before
I came to you here will be reckoned as mine;
Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben
and Simeon are mine. 6Any children born to you after
them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will
be reckoned under the names of their brothers. 7As I
was returning from Paddan, c to my sorrow Rachel died
in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a
little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside
the road to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
8When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, Who
are these?
9They are the sons God has given me here, Joseph
said to his father.
Then Israel said, Bring them to me so I may bless
them.
10Now Israels eyes were failing because of old age,
and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons
close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced
them.
11Israel said to Joseph, I never expected to see your
face again, and now God has allowed me to see your
children too.
12Then Joseph removed them from Israels knees
and bowed down with his face to the ground. 13And Joseph
took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward
Israels left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israels
right hand, and brought them close to him. 14But Israel
reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraims
head, though he was the younger, and crossing his
arms, he put his left hand on Manassehs head, even
though Manasseh was the firstborn.
15Then he blessed Joseph and said,
May the God before whom my fathers
Abraham and Isaac walked,
the God who has been my shepherd
all my life to this day,
16 the Angel who has delivered me from all harm
may he bless these boys.
May they be called by my name
and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac,
and may they increase greatly
upon the earth.
17When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand
on Ephraims head he was displeased; so he took hold of
his fathers hand to move it from Ephraims head to Manassehs
head. 18Joseph said to him, No, my father, this
one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.
19But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I
know. He too will become a people, and he too will become
great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be
greater than he, and his descendants will become a
group of nations. 20He blessed them that day and said,
In your d name will Israel pronounce this blessing:
May God make you like Ephraim and
Manasseh. 
So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.
21Then Israel said to Joseph, I am about to die, but
God will be with you e and take you e back to the land of
your e fathers. 22And to you, as one who is over your
brothers, I give the ridge of land f I took from the Amorites
with my sword and my bow.
Jacob Blesses His Sons
49 Then Jacob called for his sons and said: Gather
around so I can tell you what will happen to you
in days to come.
2 Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob;
listen to your father Israel.
3 Reuben, you are my firstborn,
my might, the first sign of my strength,
excelling in honor, excelling in power.
4 Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel,
for you went up onto your fathers bed,
onto my couch and defiled it.
5 Simeon and Levi are brothers
their swords g are weapons of violence.
6 Let me not enter their council,
let me not join their assembly,
for they have killed men in their anger
and hamstrung oxen as they pleased.
7Cursed be their anger, so fierce,
and their fury, so cruel!
I will scatter them in Jacob
and disperse them in Israel.
8 Judah, h your brothers will praise you;
your hand will be on the neck of your enemies;
your fathers sons will bow down to you.
9 You are a lions cub, O Judah;
you return from the prey, my son.
Like a lion he crouches and lies down,
like a lionesswho dares to rouse him?
10 The scepter will not depart from Judah,
nor the rulers staff from between his feet,
until he comes to whom it belongs i
and the obedience of the nations is his.
11He will tether his donkey to a vine,
his colt to the choicest branch;
he will wash his garments in wine,
his robes in the blood of grapes.
12His eyes will be darker than wine,

13 Zebulun will live by the seashore
and become a haven for ships;
his border will extend toward Sidon.

23With bitterness archers attacked him;

24But his bow remained steady,
his strong arms stayed g limber,
because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob,
because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
25 because of your fathers God, who helps you,
because of the Almighty, h who blesses you
with blessings of the heavens above,
blessings of the deep that lies below,
blessings of the breast and womb.
26 Your fathers blessings are greater
than the blessings of the ancient mountains,
than i the bounty of the age-old hills.
Let all these rest on the head of Joseph,
on the brow of the prince among j his brothers.
27 Benjamin is a ravenous wolf;
in the morning he devours the prey,
in the evening he divides the plunder.
28All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is
what their father said to them when he blessed them,
giving each the blessing appropriate to him.
The Death of Jacob
29Then he gave them these instructions: I am about
to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in
the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30the cave in
the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which
Abraham bought as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite,
along with the field. 31There Abraham and his wife
Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah
were buried, and there I buried Leah. 32The field and
the cave in it were bought from the Hittites. k
33When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his
sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last
and was gathered to his people.
50 Joseph threw himself upon his father and wept
over him and kissed him. 2Then Joseph directed
the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel.
So the physicians embalmed him, 3taking a full forty
days, for that was the time required for embalming.
And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
4When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said
to Pharaohs court, If I have found favor in your eyes,
speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him, 5My father made me
swear an oath and said, I am about to die; bury me in the
tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan. Now let me
go up and bury my father; then I will return. 
6Pharaoh said, Go up and bury your father, as he
made you swear to do.
7So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaohs
officials accompanied himthe dignitaries of his court
and all the dignitaries of Egypt 8besides all the members
of Josephs household and his brothers and those
belonging to his fathers household. Only their children
and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen. 9Chariots
and horsemen l also went up with him. It was a very
large company.
10When they reached the threshing floor of Atad,
near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and
there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning
for his father. 11When the Canaanites who lived there
saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they
said, The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of
mourning. That is why that place near the Jordan is
called Abel Mizraim. m
12So Jacobs sons did as he had commanded them:
13They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him
in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which
Abraham had bought as a burial place from Ephron the
Hittite, along with the field. 14After burying his father, Joseph
returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all
the others who had gone with him to bury his father.
Joseph Reassures His Brothers
15When Josephs brothers saw that their father was
dead, they said, What if Joseph holds a grudge against
us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?
16So they sent word to Joseph, saying, Your father left
these instructions before he died: 17This is what you
are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers
the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you
so badly. Now please forgive the sins of the servants of
the God of your father. When their message came to
him, Joseph wept.
18His brothers then came and threw themselves
down before him. We are your slaves, they said.
19But Joseph said to them, Dont be afraid. Am I in
the place of God? 20You intended to harm me, but God
intended it for good to accomplish what is now being
done, the saving of many lives. 21So then, dont be
afraid. I will provide for you and your children. And he
reassured them and spoke kindly to them.
The Death of Joseph
22Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his fathers
family. He lived a hundred and ten years 23and saw the
third generation of Ephraims children. Also the children
of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on
Josephs knees. n
24Then Joseph said to his brothers, I am about to
die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you
up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 25And Joseph made the
sons of Israel swear an oath and said, God will surely
come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up
from this place.
26So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten.
And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin
in Egypt.

The Israelites Oppressed
1 These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to
Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: 2Reuben,
Simeon, Levi and Judah; 3Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;
4Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. 5The descendants
of Jacob numbered seventy a in all; Joseph was already
in Egypt.
6Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation
died, 7but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied
greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so
that the land was filled with them.
8Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph,
came to power in Egypt. 9Look, he said to his people,
the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.
10Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will
become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will
join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.
11So they put slave masters over them to oppress
them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and
Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 12But the more they
were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread;
so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites 13and
worked them ruthlessly. 14They made their lives bitter
with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of
work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians
used them ruthlessly.
15The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives,
whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, 16When you
help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe
them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it
is a girl, let her live. 17The midwives, however, feared
God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told
them to do; they let the boys live. 18Then the king of
Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, Why
have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?
19The midwives answered Pharaoh, Hebrew women
are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give
birth before the midwives arrive.
20So God was kind to the midwives and the people
increased and became even more numerous. 21And because
the midwives feared God, he gave them families
of their own.
22Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people:
Every boy that is born b you must throw into the Nile,
but let every girl live.
The Birth of Moses
2 Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite
woman, 2and she became pregnant and gave birth to
a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him
for three months. 3But when she could hide him no longer,
she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with
tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it
among the reeds along the bank of the Nile. 4His sister
stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
5Then Pharaohs daughter went down to the Nile to
bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river
bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her
slave girl to get it. 6She opened it and saw the baby. He
was crying, and she felt sorry for him. This is one of the
Hebrew babies, she said.
7Then his sister asked Pharaohs daughter, Shall I
go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby
for you?
8Yes, go, she answered. And the girl went and got
the babys mother. 9Pharaohs daughter said to her,
Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay
you. So the woman took the baby and nursed him.
10When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaohs
daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses,
c saying, I drew him out of the water.
Moses Flees to Midian
11One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to
where his own people were and watched them at their
hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of
his own people. 12Glancing this way and that and seeing
no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
13The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting.
He asked the one in the wrong, Why are you hitting
your fellow Hebrew?
14The man said, Who made you ruler and judge
over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the
Egyptian? Then Moses was afraid and thought, What I
did must have become known.
15When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses,
but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian,
where he sat down by a well. 16Now a priest of Midian
had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and
fill the troughs to water their fathers flock. 17Some
shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses
got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.
18When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he
asked them, Why have you returned so early today?
19They answered, An Egyptian rescued us from the
shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the
flock.
20And where is he? he asked his daughters. Why
did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.
21Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his
daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage. 22Zipporah
gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, d
saying, I have become an alien in a foreign land.
23During that long period, the king of Egypt died.
The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out,
and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to
God. 24God heard their groaning and he remembered
his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.
25So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned
about them.
Moses and the Burning Bush
3 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-
in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the
flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the
mountain of God. 2There the angel of the LORD appeared
to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Mo-

ses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn
up. 3So Moses thought, I will go over and see this
strange sightwhy the bush does not burn up.
4When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look,
God called to him from within the bush, Moses! Moses!
And Moses said, Here I am.
5Do not come any closer, God said. Take off your
sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy
ground. 6Then he said, I am the God of your father, the
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid
to look at God.
7The LORD said, I have indeed seen the misery of
my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because
of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about
their suffering. 8So I have come down to rescue them
from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up
out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land
flowing with milk and honeythe home of the Canaanites,
Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
9And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I
have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.
10So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my
people the Israelites out of Egypt.
11But Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go
to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?
12And God said, I will be with you. And this will be
the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you
have brought the people out of Egypt, you a will worship
God on this mountain.
13Moses said to God, Suppose I go to the Israelites
and say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to
you, and they ask me, What is his name? Then what
shall I tell them?
14God said to Moses, I AMWHO I AM. b This is what you
are to say to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you. 
15God also said to Moses, Say to the Israelites, The
LORD, c the God of your fathersthe God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac and the God of Jacobhas sent me to
you. This is my name forever, the name by which I am
to be remembered from generation to generation.
16Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them,
The LORD, the God of your fathersthe God of Abraham,
Isaac and Jacobappeared to me and said: I have
watched over you and have seen what has been done to
you in Egypt. 17And I have promised to bring you up out
of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites,
Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusitesa
land flowing with milk and honey.
18The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you
and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to
him, The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with
us. Let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer
sacrifices to the LORD our God. 19But I know that the
king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand
compels him. 20So I will stretch out my hand and strike
the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform
among them. After that, he will let you go.
21And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed
toward this people, so that when you leave you will not
go empty-handed. 22Every woman is to ask her neighbor
and any woman living in her house for articles of silver
and gold and for clothing, which you will put on
your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the
Egyptians.
Signs for Moses
4 Moses answered, What if they do not believe me or
listen to me and say, The LORD did not appear to
you?
2Then the LORD said to him, What is that in your
hand?
A staff, he replied.
3The LORD said, Throw it on the ground.
Moses threw it on the ground and it became a
snake, and he ran from it. 4Then the LORD said to him,
Reach out your hand and take it by the tail. So Moses
reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned
back into a staff in his hand. 5This, said the LORD, is so
that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the
God of Jacobhas appeared to you.
6Then the LORD said, Put your hand inside your
cloak. So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when
he took it out, it was leprous, d like snow.
7Now put it back into your cloak, he said. So Moses
put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it
out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.
8Then the LORD said, If they do not believe you or
pay attention to the first miraculous sign, they may believe
the second. 9But if they do not believe these two
signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile
and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from
the river will become blood on the ground.
10Moses said to the LORD, O Lord, I have never been
eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken
to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.
11The LORD said to him, Who gave man his mouth?
Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or
makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD? 12Now go; I will
help you speak and will teach you what to say.
13But Moses said, O Lord, please send someone else
to do it.
14Then the LORDs anger burned against Moses and
he said, What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I
know he can speak well. He is already on his way to
meet you, and his heart will be glad when he sees you.
15You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I
will help both of you speak and will teach you what to
do. 16He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as
if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.
17But take this staff in your hand so you can perform
miraculous signs with it.
Moses Returns to Egypt
18Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law
and said to him, Let me go back to my own people in
Egypt to see if any of them are still alive.
Jethro said, Go, and I wish you well.
19Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, Go
back to Egypt, for all the men who wanted to kill you are
dead. 20So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a
donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff
of God in his hand.
21The LORD said to Moses, When you return to
Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the
wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will
harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.
22Then say to Pharaoh, This is what the LORD says: Israel
is my firstborn son, 23and I told you, Let my son go,
so he may worship me. But you refused to let him go;
so I will kill your firstborn son. 
24At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met Moses
e and was about to kill him. 25But Zipporah took a
flint knife, cut off her sons foreskin and touched Moses
feet with it. f Surely you are a bridegroom of blood
to me, she said. 26So the LORD let him alone. (At that
time she said bridegroom of blood, referring to circumcision.)
27The LORD said to Aaron, Go into the desert to
32 EXODUS 3:3
a 12 The Hebrew is plural. b 14 Or I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE c 15 The Hebrew for LORD sounds like and may be derived from the Hebrew
for I AM in verse 14. d 6 The Hebrew word was used for various diseases affecting the skinnot necessarily leprosy. e 24 Or Moses
son; Hebrew him f 25 Or and drew near Moses feet
meet Moses. So he met Moses at the mountain of God
and kissed him. 28Then Moses told Aaron everything
the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the miraculous
signs he had commanded him to perform.
29Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of
the Israelites, 30and Aaron told them everything the LORD
had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the
people, 31and they believed. And when they heard that
the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their
misery, they bowed down and worshiped.
Bricks Without Straw
5 Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and
said, This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me
in the desert. 
2Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey
him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will
not let Israel go.
3Then they said, The God of the Hebrews has met
with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the
desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may
strike us with plagues or with the sword.
4But the king of Egypt said, Moses and Aaron, why
are you taking the people away from their labor? Get
back to your work! 5Then Pharaoh said, Look, the
people of the land are now numerous, and you are
stopping them from working.
6That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave
drivers and foremen in charge of the people: 7You are
no longer to supply the people with straw for making
bricks; let them go and gather their own straw. 8But require
them to make the same number of bricks as before;
dont reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why
they are crying out, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
9Make the work harder for the men so that they keep
working and pay no attention to lies.
10Then the slave drivers and the foremen went out
and said to the people, This is what Pharaoh says: I will
not give you any more straw. 11Go and get your own
straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be
reduced at all.  12So the people scattered all over Egypt
to gather stubble to use for straw. 13The slave drivers
kept pressing them, saying, Complete the work required
of you for each day, just as when you had straw.
14The Israelite foremen appointed by Pharaohs slave
drivers were beaten and were asked, Why didnt you
meet your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?
15Then the Israelite foremen went and appealed to
Pharaoh: Why have you treated your servants this
way? 16Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told,
Make bricks! Your servants are being beaten, but the
fault is with your own people.
17Pharaoh said, Lazy, thats what you arelazy!
That is why you keep saying, Let us go and sacrifice to
the LORD. 18Now get to work. You will not be given any
straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.
19The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble
when they were told, You are not to reduce the
number of bricks required of you for each day. 20When
they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting
to meet them, 21and they said, May the LORD look upon
you and judge you! You have made us a stench to Pharaoh
and his officials and have put a sword in their hand
to kill us.
God Promises Deliverance
22Moses returned to the LORD and said, O Lord, why
have you brought trouble upon this people? Is this why
you sent me? 23Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in
your name, he has brought trouble upon this people,
and you have not rescued your people at all.
6 Then the LORD said to Moses, Now you will see
what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty
hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he
will drive them out of his country.
2God also said to Moses, I am the LORD. 3I appeared
to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, a
but by my name the LORD b I did not make myself
known to them. c 4I also established my covenant with
them to give them the land of Canaan, where they lived
as aliens. 5Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites,
whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have
remembered my covenant.
6Therefore, say to the Israelites: I am the LORD, and
I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.
I will free you from being slaves to them, and I
will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with
mighty acts of judgment. 7I will take you as my own
people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that
I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under
the yoke of the Egyptians. 8And I will bring you to
the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham,
to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession.
I am the LORD. 
9Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did
not listen to him because of their discouragement and
cruel bondage.
10Then the LORD said to Moses, 11Go, tell Pharaoh
king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country.
12But Moses said to the LORD, If the Israelites will
not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since
I speak with faltering lips d?
Family Record of Moses and Aaron
13Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron about the
Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded
them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
14These were the heads of their families e:
The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel
were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These
were the clans of Reuben.
15The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin,
Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite
woman. These were the clans of Simeon.
16These were the names of the sons of Levi according
to their records: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.
Levi lived 137 years.
17The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and
Shimei.
18The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron
and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.
19The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi.
These were the clans of Levi according to their
records.
20Amram married his fathers sister Jochebed,
who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137
years.
21The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and
Zicri.
22The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan
and Sithri.
23Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab
and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab
and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
24The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and
Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans.
25Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the
daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas.
EXODUS 6:25 33
a 3 Hebrew El-Shaddai b 3 See note at Exodus 3:15. c 3 Or Almighty, and by my name the LORD did I not let myself be known to them?
d 12 Hebrew I am uncircumcised of lips; also in verse 30 e 14 The Hebrew for families here and in verse 25 refers to units larger than
clans.
34 EXODUS 6:26
These were the heads of the Levite families, clan by
clan.
26It was this same Aaron and Moses to whom the
LORD said, Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.
27They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh
king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt.
It was the same Moses and Aaron.
Aaron to Speak for Moses
28Now when the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt, 29he
said to him, I am the LORD. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt
everything I tell you.
30But Moses said to the LORD, Since I speak with faltering
lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?
7 Then the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made you
like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be
your prophet. 2You are to say everything I command
you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the
Israelites go out of his country. 3But I will harden Pharaohs
heart, and though I multiply my miraculous signs
and wonders in Egypt, 4he will not listen to you. Then I
will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment
I will bring out my divisions, my people the Israelites.
5And the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD
when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the
Israelites out of it.
6Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded
them. 7Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eightythree
when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Aarons Staff Becomes a Snake
8The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 9When Pharaoh
says to you, Perform a miracle, then say to Aaron,
Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, and
it will become a snake.
10So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just
as the LORD commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in
front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a
snake. 11Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers,
and the Egyptian magicians also did the same
things by their secret arts: 12Each one threw down his
staff and it became a snake. But Aarons staff swallowed
up their staffs. 13Yet Pharaohs heart became hard and he
would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.
The Plague of Blood
14Then the LORD said to Moses, Pharaohs heart is
unyielding; he refuses to let the people go. 15Go to Pharaoh
in the morning as he goes out to the water. Wait on
the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand
the staff that was changed into a snake. 16Then say to
him, The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to
say to you: Let my people go, so that they may worship
me in the desert. But until now you have not listened.
17This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I
am the LORD: With the staff that is in my hand I will
strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into
blood. 18The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will
stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water. 
19The LORD said to Moses, Tell Aaron, Take your
staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of
Egyptover the streams and canals, over the ponds
and all the reservoirsand they will turn to blood.
Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in the wooden
buckets and stone jars.
20Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded.
He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh
and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all
the water was changed into blood. 21The fish in the Nile
died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians
could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in
Egypt.
22But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by
their secret arts, and Pharaohs heart became hard; he
would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD
had said. 23Instead, he turned and went into his palace,
and did not take even this to heart. 24And all the Egyptians
dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because
they could not drink the water of the river.
The Plague of Frogs
25Seven days passed after the LORD struck the Nile.
8 1Then the LORD said to Moses, Go to Pharaoh and
say to him, This is what the LORD says: Let my people
go, so that they may worship me. 2If you refuse to let
them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs.
3The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into
your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into
the houses of your officials and on your people, and
into your ovens and kneading troughs. 4The frogs will go
up on you and your people and all your officials. 
5Then the LORD said to Moses, Tell Aaron, Stretch
out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals
and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of
Egypt. 
6So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of
Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land.
7But the magicians did the same things by their secret
arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of
Egypt.
8Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said,
Pray to the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my
people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to
the LORD.
9Moses said to Pharaoh, I leave to you the honor of
setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials
and your people that you and your houses may be rid of
the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile.
10Tomorrow, Pharaoh said.
Moses replied, It will be as you say, so that you may
know there is no one like the LORD our God. 11The frogs
will leave you and your houses, your officials and your
people; they will remain only in the Nile.
12After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried
out to the LORD about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh.
13And the LORD did what Moses asked. The frogs
died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields.
14They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of
them. 15But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he
hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and
Aaron, just as the LORD had said.
The Plague of Gnats
16Then the LORD said to Moses, Tell Aaron, Stretch
out your staff and strike the dust of the ground, and
throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become
gnats. 17They did this, and when Aaron stretched out
his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the
ground, gnats came upon men and animals. All the
dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats. 18But
when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret
arts, they could not. And the gnats were on men
and animals.
19The magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger
of God. But Pharaohs heart was hard and he would not
listen, just as the LORD had said.
The Plague of Flies
20Then the LORD said to Moses, Get up early in the
morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the water
and say to him, This is what the LORD says: Let my people
go, so that they may worship me. 21If you do not let
my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and
your officials, on your people and into your houses. The
houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and even the
ground where they are.
22 But on that day I will deal differently with the
land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of
flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the LORD,
am in this land. 23I will make a distinction a between my
people and your people. This miraculous sign will occur
tomorrow. 
24And the LORD did this. Dense swarms of flies
poured into Pharaohs palace and into the houses of his
officials, and throughout Egypt the land was ruined by
the flies.
25Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and
said, Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land.
26But Moses said, That would not be right. The sacrifices
we offer the LORD our God would be detestable to
the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable
in their eyes, will they not stone us? 27We must take
a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to
the LORD our God, as he commands us.
28Pharaoh said, I will let you go to offer sacrifices to
the LORD your God in the desert, but you must not go
very far. Now pray for me.
29Moses answered, As soon as I leave you, I will pray
to the LORD, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh
and his officials and his people. Only be sure that Pharaoh
does not act deceitfully again by not letting the
people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD.
30Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD,
31and the LORD did what Moses asked: The flies left
Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained.
32But this time also Pharaoh hardened his
heart and would not let the people go.
The Plague on Livestock
9 Then the LORD said to Moses, Go to Pharaoh and
say to him, This is what the LORD, the God of the
Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may
worship me. 2If you refuse to let them go and continue
to hold them back, 3the hand of the LORD will bring a
terrible plague on your livestock in the fieldon your
horses and donkeys and camels and on your cattle and
sheep and goats. 4But the LORD will make a distinction
between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that
no animal belonging to the Israelites will die. 
5The LORD set a time and said, Tomorrow the LORD
will do this in the land. 6And the next day the LORD did
it: All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal
belonging to the Israelites died. 7Pharaoh sent
men to investigate and found that not even one of the
animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding
and he would not let the people go.
The Plague of Boils
8Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, Take handfuls
of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the
air in the presence of Pharaoh. 9It will become fine dust
over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will
break out on men and animals throughout the land.
10So they took soot from a furnace and stood before
Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils
broke out on men and animals. 11The magicians could
not stand before Moses because of the boils that were
on them and on all the Egyptians. 12But the LORD hardened
Pharaohs heart and he would not listen to Moses
and Aaron, just as the LORD had said to Moses.
The Plague of Hail
13Then the LORD said to Moses, Get up early in the
morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, This is
what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my
people go, so that they may worship me, 14or this time I
will send the full force of my plagues against you and
against your officials and your people, so you may
know that there is no one like me in all the earth. 15For
by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck
you and your people with a plague that would have
wiped you off the earth. 16But I have raised you up b for
this very purpose, that I might show you my power and
that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
17You still set yourself against my people and will not
let them go. 18Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will
send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt,
from the day it was founded till now. 19Give an order
now to bring your livestock and everything you have in
the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on
every man and animal that has not been brought in and
is still out in the field, and they will die. 
20Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of
the LORD hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock
inside. 21But those who ignored the word of the LORD
left their slaves and livestock in the field.
22Then the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your
hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt
on men and animals and on everything growing in the
fields of Egypt. 23When Moses stretched out his staff toward
the sky, the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning
flashed down to the ground. So the LORD rained
hail on the land of Egypt; 24hail fell and lightning flashed
back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of
Egypt since it had become a nation. 25Throughout Egypt
hail struck everything in the fieldsboth men and animals;
it beat down everything growing in the fields and
stripped every tree. 26The only place it did not hail was
the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were.
27Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. This
time I have sinned, he said to them. The LORD is in the
right, and I and my people are in the wrong. 28Pray to
the LORD, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I
will let you go; you dont have to stay any longer.
29Moses replied, When I have gone out of the city, I
will spread out my hands in prayer to the LORD. The
thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you
may know that the earth is the LORDs. 30But I know that
you and your officials still do not fear the LORD God.
31(The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley
had headed and the flax was in bloom. 32The wheat
and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they
ripen later.)
33Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city.
He spread out his hands toward the LORD; the thunder
and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down
on the land. 34When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail
and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his
officials hardened their hearts. 35So Pharaohs heart was
hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the
LORD had said through Moses.
The Plague of Locusts
10 Then the LORD said to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, for I
have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials
so that I may perform these miraculous signs of
mine among them 2that you may tell your children and
grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians
and how I performed my signs among them, and that
you may know that I am the LORD.
3So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to
him, This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews,
says: How long will you refuse to humble yourself before
me? Let my people go, so that they may worship
me. 4If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into
your country tomorrow. 5They will cover the face of the
ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what
little you have left after the hail, including every tree
that is growing in your fields. 6They will fill your houses
and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians
something neither your fathers nor your forefathers
EXODUS 10:6 35
a 23 Septuagint and Vulgate; Hebrew will put a deliverance b 16 Or have spared you
have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till
now.  Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
7Pharaohs officials said to him, How long will this
man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they
may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize
that Egypt is ruined?
8Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh.
Go, worship the LORD your God, he said. But just
who will be going?
9Moses answered, We will go with our young and
old, with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks
and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the
LORD.
10Pharaoh said, The LORD be with youif I let you
go, along with your women and children! Clearly you
are bent on evil. a 11No! Have only the men go; and worship
the LORD, since thats what you have been asking
for. Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaohs
presence.
12And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your
hand over Egypt so that locusts will swarm over the
land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything
left by the hail.
13So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and
the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all
that day and all that night. By morning the wind had
brought the locusts; 14they invaded all Egypt and settled
down in every area of the country in great numbers.
Never before had there been such a plague of locusts,
nor will there ever be again. 15They covered all
the ground until it was black. They devoured all that
was left after the haileverything growing in the fields
and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on
tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
16Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and
said, I have sinned against the LORD your God and
against you. 17Now forgive my sin once more and pray
to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away
from me.
18Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
19And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west
wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them
into the Red Sea. b Not a locust was left anywhere in
Egypt. 20But the LORD hardened Pharaohs heart, and he
would not let the Israelites go.
The Plague of Darkness
21Then the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your
hand toward the sky so that darkness will spread over
Egyptdarkness that can be felt. 22So Moses stretched
out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered
all Egypt for three days. 23No one could see anyone else
or leave his place for three days. Yet all the Israelites had
light in the places where they lived.
24Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, Go,
worship the LORD. Even your women and children may
go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind.
25But Moses said, You must allow us to have sacrifices
and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our
God. 26Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to
be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping
the LORD our God, and until we get there we will
not know what we are to use to worship the LORD.
27But the LORD hardened Pharaohs heart, and he
was not willing to let them go. 28Pharaoh said to Moses,
Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before
me again! The day you see my face you will die.
29Just as you say, Moses replied, I will never appear
before you again.
The Plague on the Firstborn
11 Now the LORD had said to Moses, I will bring one
more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that,
he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will
drive you out completely. 2Tell the people that men and
women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of
silver and gold. 3(The LORD made the Egyptians favorably
disposed toward the people, and Moses himself
was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaohs officials and
by the people.)
4So Moses said, This is what the LORD says: About
midnight I will go throughout Egypt. 5Every firstborn son
in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who
sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the slave girl,
who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle
as well. 6There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt
worse than there has ever been or ever will be again. 7But
among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any man or animal.
Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction
between Egypt and Israel. 8All these officials of yours
will come to me, bowing down before me and saying,
Go, you and all the people who follow you! After that I
will leave. Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.
9The LORD had said to Moses, Pharaoh will refuse to
listen to youso that my wonders may be multiplied in
Egypt. 10Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders
before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaohs
heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his
country.
The Passover
12 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, 2This
month is to be for you the first month, the first
month of your year. 3Tell the whole community of Israel
that on the tenth day of this month each man is to
take a lamb c for his family, one for each household. 4If
any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must
share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken
into account the number of people there are. You are to
determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance
with what each person will eat. 5The animals you
choose must be year-old males without defect, and you
may take them from the sheep or the goats. 6Take care
of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all
the people of the community of Israel must slaughter
them at twilight. 7Then they are to take some of the
blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes
of the houses where they eat the lambs. 8That
same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the
fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without
yeast. 9Do not eat the meat raw or cooked in water, but
roast it over the firehead, legs and inner parts. 10Do
not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning,
you must burn it. 11This is how you are to eat it:
with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on
your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is
the LORDs Passover.
12On that same night I will pass through Egypt and
strike down every firstbornboth men and animals
and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am
the LORD. 13The blood will be a sign for you on the
houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will
pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you
when I strike Egypt.
14This is a day you are to commemorate; for the
generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to
the LORDa lasting ordinance. 15For seven days you are
to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove
the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything
with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh
must be cut off from Israel. 16On the first day hold
36 EXODUS 10:7
a 10 Or Be careful, trouble is in store for you! b 19 Hebrew Yam Suph; that is, Sea of Reeds c 3 The Hebrew word can mean lamb or
kid; also in verse 4.
a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day.
Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food
for everyone to eatthat is all you may do.
17Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because
it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out
of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for
the generations to come. 18In the first month you are to
eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the
fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.
19For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses.
And whoever eats anything with yeast in it must be cut
off from the community of Israel, whether he is an alien
or native-born. 20Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever
you live, you must eat unleavened bread.
21Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and
said to them, Go at once and select the animals for
your families and slaughter the Passover lamb. 22Take a
bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and
put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of
the doorframe. Not one of you shall go out the door of
his house until morning. 23When the LORD goes through
the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the
blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will
pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer
to enter your houses and strike you down.
24Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for
you and your descendants. 25When you enter the land
that the LORD will give you as he promised, observe this
ceremony. 26And when your children ask you, What
does this ceremony mean to you? 27then tell them, It is
the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the
houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes
when he struck down the Egyptians.  Then the people
bowed down and worshiped. 28The Israelites did just
what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.
29At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn
in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the
throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the
dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well.
30Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got
up during the night, and there was loud wailing in
Egypt, for there was not a house without someone
dead.
The Exodus
31During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and
Aaron and said, Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites!
Go, worship the LORD as you have requested.
32Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go.
And also bless me.
33The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave
the country. For otherwise, they said, we will all die!
34So the people took their dough before the yeast was
added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading
troughs wrapped in clothing. 35The Israelites did as Moses
instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of
silver and gold and for clothing. 36The LORD had made
the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people,
and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered
the Egyptians.
37The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth.
There were about six hundred thousand men on foot,
besides women and children. 38Many other people
went up with them, as well as large droves of livestock,
both flocks and herds. 39With the dough they had
brought from Egypt, they baked cakes of unleavened
bread. The dough was without yeast because they had
been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare
food for themselves.
40Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in
Egypt a was 430 years. 41At the end of the 430 years, to
the very day, all the LORDs divisions left Egypt. 42Because
the LORD kept vigil that night to bring them out of
Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to
honor the LORD for the generations to come.
Passover Restrictions
43The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, These are the
regulations for the Passover:
No foreigner is to eat of it. 44Any slave you have
bought may eat of it after you have circumcised him,
45but a temporary resident and a hired worker may not
eat of it.
46It must be eaten inside one house; take none of
the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the
bones. 47The whole community of Israel must celebrate
it.
48An alien living among you who wants to celebrate
the LORDs Passover must have all the males in his
household circumcised; then he may take part like one
born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat of it.
49The same law applies to the native-born and to the
alien living among you.
50All the Israelites did just what the LORD had commanded
Moses and Aaron. 51And on that very day the
LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.
Consecration of the Firstborn
13 The LORD said to Moses, 2Consecrate to me every
firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb
among the Israelites belongs to me, whether man or
animal.
3Then Moses said to the people, Commemorate
this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land
of slavery, because the LORD brought you out of it with a
mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast. 4Today, in
the month of Abib, you are leaving. 5When the LORD
brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites,
Hivites and Jebusitesthe land he swore to your
forefathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and
honeyyou are to observe this ceremony in this
month: 6For seven days eat bread made without yeast
and on the seventh day hold a festival to the LORD. 7Eat
unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing
with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any
yeast be seen anywhere within your borders. 8On that
day tell your son, I do this because of what the LORD
did for me when I came out of Egypt. 9This observance
will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder
on your forehead that the law of the LORD is to be on
your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his
mighty hand. 10You must keep this ordinance at the appointed
time year after year.
11After the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites
and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to
you and your forefathers, 12you are to give over to the
LORD the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn
males of your livestock belong to the LORD. 13Redeem
with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem
it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among
your sons.
14In days to come, when your son asks you, What
does this mean? say to him, With a mighty hand the
LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
15When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the
LORD killed every firstborn in Egypt, both man and animal.
This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the first male offspring
of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn
sons. 16And it will be like a sign on your hand and a
symbol on your forehead that the LORD brought us out
of Egypt with his mighty hand.
EXODUS 13:16 37
a 40 Masoretic Text; Samaritan Pentateuch and Septuagint Egypt and Canaan
Crossing the Sea
17When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead
them on the road through the Philistine country,
though that was shorter. For God said, If they face war,
they might change their minds and return to Egypt.
18So God led the people around by the desert road toward
the Red Sea. a The Israelites went up out of Egypt
armed for battle.
19Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because
Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear an oath. He
had said, God will surely come to your aid, and then
you must carry my bones up with you from this place. b
20After leaving Succoth they camped at Etham on
the edge of the desert. 21By day the LORD went ahead of
them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and
by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they
could travel by day or night. 22Neither the pillar of
cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in
front of the people.
14 Then the LORD said to Moses, 2Tell the Israelites to
turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between
Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly
opposite Baal Zephon. 3Pharaoh will think, The
Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion,
hemmed in by the desert. 4And I will harden Pharaohs
heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for
myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians
will know that I am the LORD. So the Israelites did
this.
5When the king of Egypt was told that the people
had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds
about them and said, What have we done? We have let
the Israelites go and have lost their services! 6So he
had his chariot made ready and took his army with
him. 7He took six hundred of the best chariots, along
with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all
of them. 8The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king
of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were
marching out boldly. 9The Egyptiansall Pharaohs
horses and chariots, horsemen c and troopspursued
the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the
sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.
10As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up,
and there were the Egyptians, marching after them.
They were terrified and cried out to the LORD. 11They
said to Moses, Was it because there were no graves in
Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What
have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
12Didnt we say to you in Egypt, Leave us alone; let us
serve the Egyptians? It would have been better for us to
serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!
13Moses answered the people, Do not be afraid.
Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD
will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you
will never see again. 14The LORD will fight for you; you
need only to be still.
15Then the LORD said to Moses, Why are you crying
out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on. 16Raise your
staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the
water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry
ground. 17I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so
that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory
through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots
and his horsemen. 18The Egyptians will know that I am
the LORD when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots
and his horsemen.
19Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in
front of Israels army, withdrew and went behind them.
The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood
behind them, 20coming between the armies of Egypt
and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought
darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so
neither went near the other all night long.
21Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,
and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a
strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters
were divided, 22and the Israelites went through the sea
on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on
their left.
23The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaohs
horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into
the sea. 24During the last watch of the night the LORD
looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the
Egyptian army and threw it into confusion. 25He made
the wheels of their chariots come off d so that they had
difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, Lets get
away from the Israelites! The LORD is fighting for them
against Egypt.
26Then the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your
hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over
the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen. 27Moses
stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak
the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing
toward e it, and the LORD swept them into the sea.
28The water flowed back and covered the chariots and
horsementhe entire army of Pharaoh that had followed
the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
29But the Israelites went through the sea on dry
ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their
left. 30That day the LORD saved Israel from the hands of
the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead
on the shore. 31And when the Israelites saw the great
power the LORD displayed against the Egyptians, the
people feared the LORD and put their trust in him and in
Moses his servant.
The Song of Moses and Miriam
15 Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to
the LORD:
I will sing to the LORD,
for he is highly exalted.
The horse and its rider
he has hurled into the sea.
2 The LORD is my strength and my song;
he has become my salvation.
He is my God, and I will praise him,
my fathers God, and I will exalt him.
3 The LORD is a warrior;
the LORD is his name.
4 Pharaohs chariots and his army
he has hurled into the sea.
The best of Pharaohs officers
are drowned in the Red Sea. f
5 The deep waters have covered them;
they sank to the depths like a stone.
6 Your right hand, O LORD,
was majestic in power.
Your right hand, O LORD,
shattered the enemy.
7 In the greatness of your majesty
you threw down those who opposed you.
You unleashed your burning anger;
it consumed them like stubble.
8By the blast of your nostrils
the waters piled up.
The surging waters stood firm like a wall;
the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.
38 EXODUS 13:17
a 18 Hebrew Yam Suph; that is, Sea of Reeds b 19 See Gen. 50:25. c 9 Or charioteers; also in verses 17, 18, 23, 26 and 28 d 25 Or He
jammed the wheels of their chariots (see Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint and Syriac) e 27 Or from f 4 Hebrew Yam Suph; that is,
Sea of Reeds; also in verse 22
9 The enemy boasted,
I will pursue, I will overtake them.
I will divide the spoils;
I will gorge myself on them.
I will draw my sword
and my hand will destroy them.
10But you blew with your breath,
and the sea covered them.
They sank like lead
in the mighty waters.
11 Who among the gods is like you, O LORD?
Who is like you
majestic in holiness,
awesome in glory,
working wonders?
12 You stretched out your right hand
and the earth swallowed them.
13 In your unfailing love you will lead
the people you have redeemed.
In your strength you will guide them
to your holy dwelling.
14 The nations will hear and tremble;
anguish will grip the people of Philistia.
15 The chiefs of Edom will be terrified,
the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling,
the people a of Canaan will melt away;
16 terror and dread will fall upon them.
By the power of your arm
they will be as still as a stone
until your people pass by, O LORD,
until the people you bought b pass by.
17 You will bring them in and plant them
on the mountain of your inheritance
the place, O LORD, you made for your dwelling,
the sanctuary, O Lord, your hands established.
18 The LORD will reign
for ever and ever.
19When Pharaohs horses, chariots and horsemen c
went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea
back over them, but the Israelites walked through the
sea on dry ground. 20Then Miriam the prophetess, Aarons
sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the
women followed her, with tambourines and dancing.
21Miriam sang to them:
Sing to the LORD,
for he is highly exalted.
The horse and its rider
he has hurled into the sea.
The Waters of Marah and Elim
22Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they
went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled
in the desert without finding water. 23When they
came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it
was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah. d) 24So
the people grumbled against Moses, saying, What are
we to drink?
25Then Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD
showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water,
and the water became sweet.
There the LORD made a decree and a law for them,
and there he tested them. 26He said, If you listen carefully
to the voice of the LORD your God and do what is
right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands
and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of
the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the
LORD, who heals you.
27Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve
springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there
near the water.
Manna and Quail
16 The whole Israelite community set out from Elim
and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between
Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second
month after they had come out of Egypt. 2In the desert
the whole community grumbled against Moses and
Aaron. 3The Israelites said to them, If only we had died
by the LORDs hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of
meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have
brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly
to death.
4Then the LORD said to Moses, I will rain down
bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out
each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I
will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.
5On the sixth day they are to prepare what
they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they
gather on the other days.
6So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, In the
evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought
you out of Egypt, 7and in the morning you will see the
glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling
against him. Who are we, that you should grumble
against us? 8Moses also said, You will know that it was
the LORD when he gives you meat to eat in the evening
and all the bread you want in the morning, because he
has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we?
You are not grumbling against us, but against the LORD.
9Then Moses told Aaron, Say to the entire Israelite
community, Come before the LORD, for he has heard
your grumbling. 
10While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite
community, they looked toward the desert, and there
was the glory of the LORD appearing in the cloud.
11The LORD said to Moses, 12I have heard the grumbling
of the Israelites. Tell them, At twilight you will eat
meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread.
Then you will know that I am the LORD your God. 
13That evening quail came and covered the camp,
and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the
camp. 14When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on
the ground appeared on the desert floor. 15When the Israelites
saw it, they said to each other, What is it? For
they did not know what it was.
Moses said to them, It is the bread the LORD has given
you to eat. 16This is what the LORD has commanded:
Each one is to gather as much as he needs. Take an
omer e for each person you have in your tent. 
17The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered
much, some little. 18And when they measured it by the
omer, he who gathered much did not have too much,
and he who gathered little did not have too little. Each
one gathered as much as he needed.
19Then Moses said to them, No one is to keep any of
it until morning.
20However, some of them paid no attention to Moses;
they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of
maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with
them.
21Each morning everyone gathered as much as he
needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.
22On the sixth day, they gathered twice as muchtwo
omers f for each personand the leaders of the community
came and reported this to Moses. 23He said to
them, This is what the LORD commanded: Tomorrow is
to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake
what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil.
Save whatever is left and keep it until morning. 
EXODUS 16:23 39
a 15 Or rulers b 16 Or created c 19 Or charioteers d 23 Marah means bitter. e 16 That is, probably about 2 quarts (about 2 liters);
also in verses 18, 32, 33 and 36 f 22 That is, probably about 4 quarts (about 4.5 liters)
24So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded,
and it did not stink or get maggots in it. 25Eat
it today, Moses said, because today is a Sabbath to the
LORD. You will not find any of it on the ground today.
26Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day,
the Sabbath, there will not be any.
27Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the
seventh day to gather it, but they found none. 28Then
the LORD said to Moses, How long will you a refuse to
keep my commands and my instructions? 29Bear in
mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is
why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone
is to stay where he is on the seventh day; no one
is to go out. 30So the people rested on the seventh day.
31The people of Israel called the bread manna. b It
was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers
made with honey. 32Moses said, This is what the LORD
has commanded: Take an omer of manna and keep it
for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I
gave you to eat in the desert when I brought you out of
Egypt. 
33So Moses said to Aaron, Take a jar and put an
omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be
kept for the generations to come.
34As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron put the
manna in front of the Testimony, that it might be kept.
35The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came
to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they
reached the border of Canaan.
36(An omer is one tenth of an ephah.)
Water From the Rock
17 The whole Israelite community set out from the
Desert of Sin, traveling from place to place as the
LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but
there was no water for the people to drink. 2So they
quarreled with Moses and said, Give us water to
drink.
Moses replied, Why do you quarrel with me? Why
do you put the LORD to the test?
3But the people were thirsty for water there, and
they grumbled against Moses. They said, Why did you
bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children
and livestock die of thirst?
4Then Moses cried out to the LORD, What am I to do
with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.
5The LORD answered Moses, Walk on ahead of the
people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and
take in your hand the staff with which you struck the
Nile, and go. 6I will stand there before you by the rock at
Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for
the people to drink. So Moses did this in the sight of the
elders of Israel. 7And he called the place Massah c and
Meribah d because the Israelites quarreled and because
they tested the LORD saying, Is the LORD among us or
not?
The Amalekites Defeated
8The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at
Rephidim. 9Moses said to Joshua, Choose some of our
men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will
stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my
hands.
10So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered,
and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the
hill. 11As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites
were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the
Amalekites were winning. 12When Moses hands grew
tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat
on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands upone on one
side, one on the otherso that his hands remained
steady till sunset. 13So Joshua overcame the Amalekite
army with the sword.
14Then the LORD said to Moses, Write this on a scroll
as something to be remembered and make sure that
Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the
memory of Amalek from under heaven.
15Moses built an altar and called it The LORD is my
Banner. 16He said, For hands were lifted up to the
throne of the LORD. The e LORD will be at war against the
Amalekites from generation to generation.
Jethro Visits Moses
18 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and father-in-law
of Moses, heard of everything God had done for
Moses and for his people Israel, and how the LORD had
brought Israel out of Egypt.
2After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his
father-in-law Jethro received her 3and her two sons.
One son was named Gershom, f for Moses said, I have
become an alien in a foreign land; 4and the other was
named Eliezer, g for he said, My fathers God was my
helper; he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.
5Jethro, Moses father-in-law, together with Moses
sons and wife, came to him in the desert, where he was
camped near the mountain of God. 6Jethro had sent
word to him, I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to
you with your wife and her two sons.
7So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and
bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other
and then went into the tent. 8Moses told his father-inlaw
about everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh
and the Egyptians for Israels sake and about all the
hardships they had met along the way and how the
LORD had saved them.
9Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good
things the LORD had done for Israel in rescuing them
from the hand of the Egyptians. 10He said, Praise be to
the LORD, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians
and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from
the hand of the Egyptians. 11Now I know that the LORD
is greater than all other gods, for he did this to those
who had treated Israel arrogantly. 12Then Jethro, Moses
father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices
to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel
to eat bread with Moses father-in-law in the presence
of God.
13The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge
for the people, and they stood around him from morning
till evening. 14When his father-in-law saw all that
Moses was doing for the people, he said, What is this
you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as
judge, while all these people stand around you from
morning till evening?
15Moses answered him, Because the people come to
me to seek Gods will. 16Whenever they have a dispute, it
is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and
inform them of Gods decrees and laws.
17Moses father-in-law replied, What you are doing is
not good. 18You and these people who come to you will
only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you;
you cannot handle it alone. 19Listen now to me and I will
give you some advice, and may God be with you. You
must be the peoples representative before God and
bring their disputes to him. 20Teach them the decrees
and laws, and show them the way to live and the duties
they are to perform. 21But select capable men from all
the peoplemen who fear God, trustworthy men who
hate dishonest gainand appoint them as officials over
thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 22Have them
